  <Accordion title="From Idea to App Store" icon="store">
    Create, test in the iOS Simulator, and publish to TestFlight - all from one app. Everything you need to go from idea to beta testers.

## The Journey from Idea to App

<Steps>
  <Step title="Describe Your Idea">
    Tell Nativeline what kind of app you want to build. "A habit tracker with streaks," "A recipe organizer," or "A meditation timer" - anything you can imagine.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize with the Wizard">
    Answer a few quick questions about your app's audience, style, and colors. This helps the AI understand your vision.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Chat to Build Features">
    Request features by chatting naturally. "Add a dark mode toggle," "Create a profile screen," or "Fix the scrolling issue" - just ask!
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Instantly">
    Every change automatically builds and launches in the iOS Simulator. See your app running on a virtual iPhone in seconds.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish to TestFlight">
    When you're ready, deploy your app to Apple's TestFlight with one click. Share with up to 10,000 beta testers.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Can You Build?

Nativeline is perfect for:

- **Personal apps** - Task managers, habit trackers, journals
- **Utility apps** - Calculators, converters, timers
- **Social apps** - Photo sharing, messaging, community boards
- **Productivity apps** - Note-taking, todo lists, calendars
- **Lifestyle apps** - Recipes, fitness trackers, meditation guides
- **And much more** - If you can describe it, you can build it

<Note>
  Nativeline works best for apps focused on a single purpose. Complex apps with dozens of features should be built incrementally, adding one feature at a time.
</Note>

## System Requirements

Before you start, make sure you have:

- **Mac** running macOS 13 (Ventura) or later
- **Xcode** (free from the Mac App Store)
- **Apple ID** for testing and publishing
- **Internet connection** for AI features
