## Managing Multiple Versions

You can have:
- TestFlight for beta testing next version
- App Store with current live version

Both can run simultaneously.

### Version Numbers

Use semantic versioning:
```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
1.0.0 → 1.0.1 (bug fix)
1.0.1 → 1.1.0 (new feature)
1.1.0 → 2.0.0 (major change)
```

## Annual Maintenance

### Yearly Tasks

- Renew Apple Developer membership
- Update privacy policy if data practices change
- Review and update app for latest iOS
- Refresh screenshots and description
- Check for deprecated APIs

### Developer Program Renewal

Apple sends reminders before your $99 renewal:
- 30 days before
- 7 days before
- Day of expiration

If you miss renewal, your apps remain on the App Store but you can't submit updates.
