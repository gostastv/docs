# App Review Guidelines

Apple reviews every app before it goes on the App Store. Understanding what they look for helps you avoid rejection.

## The Five Principles

Apple organizes guidelines around five themes:

### 1. Safety

Your app must be safe for users:
- No harmful or objectionable content
- User privacy respected
- No dangerous physical activities encouraged

### 2. Performance

Your app must work well:
- No crashes or bugs
- Accurate metadata
- Complete functionality

### 3. Business

Fair business practices:
- Clear pricing
- No misleading claims
- Proper use of Apple's payment systems

### 4. Design

Quality user experience:
- Follow Human Interface Guidelines
- Intuitive navigation
- Accessible to all users

### 5. Legal

Compliance with laws:
- No copyright infringement
- No illegal activities
- Proper licensing

## Most Common Rejection Reasons

### 1. Crashes and Bugs

**Issue:** App crashes during use or review

**Prevention:**
- Test thoroughly on real devices
- Test all user flows
- Test edge cases (no internet, low storage)
- Use TestFlight feedback to find issues

### 2. Broken Links

**Issue:** Links in app or metadata don't work

**Check:**
- Privacy policy URL
- Support URL
- Website links
- Deep links within app

### 3. Placeholder Content

**Issue:** "Lorem ipsum" or "coming soon" in app

**Prevention:**
- Remove all placeholder text
- Disable or hide incomplete features
- Only submit when app is complete

### 4. Inaccurate Description

**Issue:** Description doesn't match what app does

**Prevention:**
- Describe actual features
- Don't overpromise
- Update description when features change

### 5. Insufficient Functionality

**Issue:** App doesn't do enough to be useful

**Prevention:**
- Ensure core value proposition works
- Don't submit "hello world" apps
- Have at least one complete feature set

### Communication

If Apple needs information:

## Handling Rejections

### If Rejected

1. **Read the rejection carefully** — Apple provides specific reasons
2. **Fix the issues** — Address each point
3. **Resubmit** — With a new build if needed

### Metadata Rejection

If only metadata was rejected:
- Fix text/screenshots/links
- Resubmit without new build
- Usually faster resolution

### Appeal Process

If you believe rejection was wrong:
- Reply to the rejection email
- Explain your position clearly
- Provide evidence if applicable
- Don't be confrontational
