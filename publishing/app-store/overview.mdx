## First-Time Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Allow extra time" icon="clock">
    First submissions often take longer and may need revisions. Plan for 1-2 weeks from submission to launch.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Read rejection feedback carefully" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Apple provides specific reasons. Address each point precisely in your resubmission.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Don't argue, fix" icon="wrench">
    If rejected, fix the issue rather than debating with review. Appeals rarely succeed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Start with TestFlight" icon="paper-plane">
    Beta testing catches most issues before App Store review. Use that feedback.
  </Accordion>
