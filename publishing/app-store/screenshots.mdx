# Screenshots & Preview

Screenshots are often the deciding factor in whether someone downloads your app. Make them count.

## What You Need

### Required Screenshots

You need screenshots for each device size you support:

| Device | Size (pixels) | Required |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| iPhone 6.7" | 1290 x 2796 | Yes (if supporting Pro Max) |
| iPhone 6.5" | 1284 x 2778 | Yes |
| iPhone 5.5" | 1242 x 2208 | Yes |
| iPad Pro 12.9" | 2048 x 2732 | Yes (if iPad app) |
| iPad Pro 11" | 1668 x 2388 | Optional |

### Screenshot Limits

- Minimum: 3 screenshots per device size
- Maximum: 10 screenshots per device size
- App previews count toward the 10 limit

<Note>
  App Store Connect can automatically scale from larger to smaller sizes. Upload for 6.7" and it can generate 6.5" and 5.5".
</Note>

## Screenshot Best Practices

### Show the App, Not Just Screens

**Good:** App in use with context
**Bad:** Raw screenshots with no explanation

### Highlight Key Features

Focus on what makes your app valuable:
1. Main feature first (most visible in search)
2. Supporting features after
3. End with credibility (awards, reviews, etc.)

### Use Text Overlays

Add brief explanatory text:
- Large, readable fonts
- 5 words or fewer per screen
- Consistent style throughout

### Examples

**First Screenshot:** Hero shot of main feature
```
"Edit photos in seconds"
[Phone showing photo editor]
```

**Second Screenshot:** Key feature
```
"50+ professional filters"
[Filter selection screen]
```

**Third Screenshot:** Benefit
```
"Share anywhere instantly"
[Share screen]
```

## Design Guidelines

### Do

- ✅ Use high contrast text
- ✅ Match your app's color scheme
- ✅ Be consistent across all screenshots
- ✅ Show real content (not Lorem ipsum)
- ✅ Test readability on small screens

### Don't

- ❌ Use tiny text
- ❌ Overwhelm with too much information
- ❌ Show empty states or errors
- ❌ Include device status bars
- ❌ Use copyrighted content without permission

---

## Localization

If your app supports multiple languages:

- Provide screenshots for each language
- Translate text overlays
- Use region-appropriate content
- Consider cultural differences in design

---

## Uploading Screenshots

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to App Store Connect">
    Navigate to your app → App Store tab
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scroll to Screenshots">
    Find the Media section
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select device size">
    Click on each size tab
  </Step>
  <Step title="Drag and drop">
    Upload screenshots in desired order
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reorder if needed">
    Drag to rearrange
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Screenshot Order

Order matters — especially the first three:

| Position | Visibility | Content |
|----------|------------|---------|
| 1st | Search results | Your best, most compelling image |
| 2nd | Search results | Second most important feature |
| 3rd | Search results | Third key feature |
| 4th+ | Product page only | Supporting features |

---

## Testing Your Screenshots

### Preview in App Store Connect

Use the preview feature to see how screenshots appear in:
- Search results
- Product page
- Different device sizes

### Check Competitors

Look at top apps in your category:
- What style do they use?
- How much text?
- What order?

### A/B Testing (after launch)

App Store Connect offers product page optimization:
- Test different screenshots
- See which perform better
- Apply winners

## Common Mistakes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Raw screenshots with no context" icon="image">
    Adding text overlays and context significantly increases conversion. A plain screenshot doesn't sell your app.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Too much text" icon="text">
    Keep text minimal. If users have to read a paragraph, they'll scroll past.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Wrong order" icon="sort">
    Your best screenshot should be first. Don't bury the best feature.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Inconsistent style" icon="palette">
    Use the same fonts, colors, and layout style throughout for professional appearance.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
