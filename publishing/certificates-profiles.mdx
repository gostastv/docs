# Certificates & Profiles

Code signing is how Apple verifies that your app comes from you and hasn't been tampered with. Nativeline handles most of this automatically, but understanding the basics helps when troubleshooting.

## The Simple Version

```
Your App + Certificate + Profile = Signed App
         (who you are)  (what's allowed)
```

Apple requires every app to be signed before it can run on a device or be distributed.

---

## Why Code Signing Exists

1. **Identity** — Proves you made the app
2. **Integrity** — Ensures the app hasn't been modified
3. **Authorization** — Controls what the app can do

---

## Key Concepts

### Certificates

A certificate proves your identity as a developer.

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Development | Run apps on your devices during development |
| Distribution | Distribute via TestFlight and App Store |

### Provisioning Profiles

A profile links your certificate to your app and specifies:
- Which app (by Bundle ID)
- Which capabilities (push, Sign in with Apple, etc.)
- Which devices (for development)

### Bundle ID

A unique identifier for your app, like `com.yourname.appname`. This must be consistent across all profiles.

---

## How Nativeline Handles This

### Automatic Management

Nativeline can manage code signing automatically:

1. Creates certificates when needed
2. Generates provisioning profiles
3. Signs your app before uploading

To use automatic signing:
```
Settings → Signing → Automatic
```

### Manual Management

For advanced users or specific requirements:

1. Create certificates in Apple Developer portal
2. Create provisioning profiles manually
3. Import into Nativeline

## Setting Up (First Time)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Apple Developer Account">
    In Nativeline, go to Settings → Account → Connect Apple Developer
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign in with Apple ID">
    Use the Apple ID associated with your Developer account
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable automatic signing">
    Let Nativeline manage certificates and profiles
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select your team">
    If you're part of multiple teams, choose the correct one
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Profile Types

### Development Profile

- For testing on your devices
- Includes specific device IDs
- Can test all app capabilities

### App Store Profile

- For TestFlight and App Store distribution
- No device restrictions
- Used for final distribution builds

### Ad Hoc Profile

- For distributing outside App Store (up to 100 devices)
- Requires specific device IDs
- Rarely needed with TestFlight available

---

## Common Scenarios

### Building for Simulator

No code signing required. Simulator uses your Mac's identity.

### Testing on Your iPhone

Requires:
- Development certificate
- Development provisioning profile
- Your device registered in Apple Developer portal

### Uploading to TestFlight

Requires:
- Distribution certificate
- App Store provisioning profile

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No signing certificate found"

**Cause:** Certificate missing or expired

**Fix:**
1. Go to Settings → Signing
2. Click "Reset Certificates"
3. Let Nativeline create new ones

### "Provisioning profile doesn't match"

**Cause:** Bundle ID mismatch

**Fix:**
1. Check Bundle ID in Settings → App Identity
2. Ensure it matches what's in Apple Developer portal
3. Regenerate profile if needed

### "Profile doesn't include capability"

**Cause:** App uses a capability not in the profile

**Fix:**
1. Enable the capability in Apple Developer portal
2. Regenerate the provisioning profile
3. Rebuild your app

### "Certificate has been revoked"

**Cause:** Someone revoked your certificate

**Fix:**
1. Go to Settings → Signing
2. Reset certificates
3. Rebuild your app

---

## Certificate Limits

Apple limits the number of certificates:

| Type | Limit |
|------|-------|
| Development | 2 per team |
| Distribution | 3 per team |

<Warning>
  Revoking a distribution certificate affects ALL apps signed with it. Be careful in team environments.
</Warning>

---

## Device Registration

For development testing, devices must be registered:

### Automatic Registration

When you connect your iPhone and run from Nativeline, it can register automatically.

### Manual Registration

1. Get device UDID (from Finder when connected)
2. Add in Apple Developer portal → Devices
3. Regenerate provisioning profile

### Device Limits

- Up to 100 devices per type per year
- Resets when you renew your Developer account
- Can remove devices once per year

---

## Team Considerations

### Multiple Team Members

If working with a team:
- Each developer has their own development certificate
- Share distribution certificates carefully
- Use role-based access in App Store Connect

### Multiple Macs

Each Mac needs:
- The certificate installed
- Access to the private key
- Provisioning profiles downloaded

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use automatic signing" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Let Nativeline handle code signing unless you have specific requirements. It prevents most common issues.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Backup certificates" icon="download">
    Export certificates from Keychain Access and store securely. Losing your distribution certificate means regenerating profiles.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Don't share certificates freely" icon="lock">
    Distribution certificates give access to upload builds for your apps. Only share with trusted team members.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Check expiration dates" icon="calendar">
    Certificates and profiles expire. Renew before they expire to avoid distribution interruptions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

## Expiration

### Certificate Expiration

- Development: 1 year
- Distribution: 1 year

When expired:
- Cannot create new builds with that certificate
- Existing apps continue working
- Create new certificate to continue

### Profile Expiration

- Profiles expire when the certificate they use expires
- Or when the Developer Program membership lapses
