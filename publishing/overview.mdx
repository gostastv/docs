## Common Concerns

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to pay $99 for TestFlight?" icon="dollar-sign">
    Yes. TestFlight requires an Apple Developer account, which costs $99/year. There's no way around this for distribution.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long does App Store review take?" icon="clock">
    Most apps are reviewed within 24-48 hours. First-time submissions and apps with in-app purchases may take longer.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can my app get rejected?" icon="xmark">
    Yes. Apple reviews apps against their guidelines. Common rejection reasons are covered in our Review Guidelines section.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I just want friends to test?" icon="users">
    TestFlight is the way. You can add up to 100 internal testers immediately. External testers (up to 10,000) require a quick beta review.
