If your Apple ID has payment history and matches your ID, verification may be instant.

### Manual Verification

You may be asked to:

- Take a selfie for comparison
- Have a phone or video call with Apple

<Tip>
  Use the same name on your Apple ID that appears on your government ID to speed up verification.
