# Uploading Builds

Once TestFlight is set up, uploading new builds is straightforward. This guide covers the upload process and what to expect.

## Before Uploading

### Increment Build Number

Each upload requires a unique build number:

```
Settings → App Identity → Build Number
```

Build numbers must always increase:
- Build 1 → Build 2 → Build 3
- Can skip numbers (1 → 5 is fine)
- Cannot reuse numbers

### Version vs Build Number

| Field | What It Is | When to Change |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| Version | User-facing (1.0.0) | New features, major updates |
| Build | Internal (1, 2, 3...) | Every upload |

Example progression:
```
Version 1.0.0, Build 1  → First TestFlight upload
Version 1.0.0, Build 2  → Bug fix
Version 1.0.0, Build 3  → Another fix
Version 1.1.0, Build 4  → New feature (version bumped)
```

  <Step title="Start upload">
    Click the **plane icon** (✈️) in the top-right toolbar to start the TestFlight upload
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for build">
    Nativeline creates a release build (may take several minutes)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for upload">
    Binary uploads to App Store Connect
  </Step>
  <Step title="Done">
    You'll see a confirmation when complete
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Upload Progress

During upload, you'll see:

1. **Building** — Creating release binary
2. **Signing** — Applying distribution certificate
3. **Uploading** — Sending to Apple servers
4. **Processing** — Apple validating (this happens in App Store Connect)

---

## After Upload

### Immediate

- Build appears in App Store Connect under TestFlight tab
- Status shows "Processing"

### Processing Time

- Usually 10-30 minutes
- Can take longer during busy periods
- You'll get an email when processing completes

### Processing Status

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Processing | Apple is validating your build |
| Ready to Submit | Can be sent to testers |
| Missing Compliance | Need to answer export compliance |
| Invalid Binary | There's an issue (check email) |

---

## Export Compliance

After processing, you'll need to answer export compliance:

**Question:** Does your app use encryption?

**Common Answer:** If your app only uses HTTPS (most apps):
- Select "Yes"
- Confirm it only uses HTTPS or other exempt encryption
- Save

<Tip>
  Standard HTTPS for API calls is exempt. If you're not implementing custom encryption, you're likely exempt.
</Tip>

To avoid answering each time, add to your Info.plist:
```
ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption: NO
```

Nativeline can set this for you:
```
Set export compliance to no custom encryption
```

---

## Automatic Distribution

Once a build is processed, you can enable automatic distribution to testers:

1. In App Store Connect → TestFlight
2. Select your tester group
3. Enable "Automatic Distribution"
4. New builds are automatically sent to that group

---

## Multiple Builds

You can have multiple builds available:

### Managing Builds

- Expire old builds manually
- Add notes to builds for tracking
- Enable/disable builds for specific groups

### Best Practice

- Keep recent builds active
- Expire very old builds to avoid confusion
- Use build notes to track what changed

---

## Build Notes

Add notes to help testers know what changed:

1. In App Store Connect → TestFlight → select build
2. Click "Test Details"
3. Add "What to Test" notes

Example:
```
What to Test:
- New photo filter feature
- Fixed crash when saving
- Please test on both WiFi and cellular
```

## Upload Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Upload seems stuck" icon="clock">
    Large apps take time. The progress bar may seem stuck during actual file transfer. Wait at least 30 minutes before troubleshooting.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keep internet stable" icon="wifi">
    Uploads require consistent internet. If connection drops, you'll need to restart the upload.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Close other heavy apps" icon="microchip">
    Building and uploading uses significant RAM and CPU. Close other intensive apps for faster uploads.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Upload during off-peak hours" icon="moon">
    Apple's servers are faster during off-peak hours. Early morning or late night uploads often process faster.
  </Accordion>

## Common Upload Issues

### "Invalid Binary"

**Cause:** Something is wrong with the build

**Check:**
- Email from Apple with specific error
- Common issues: missing icon, wrong provisioning, invalid entitlements

### "Processing Failed"

**Cause:** Apple couldn't process the build

**Fix:**
- Increment build number
- Upload again
- If persists, check Apple System Status

### "Upload Failed"

**Cause:** Network or authentication issue

**Fix:**
- Check internet connection
- Re-authenticate with App Store Connect in Nativeline
- Try again
