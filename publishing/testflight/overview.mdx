# TestFlight

TestFlight is Apple's official platform for beta testing iOS apps. It lets you share your app with testers before releasing publicly on the App Store.

## What is TestFlight?

TestFlight is a free app from Apple that allows:

- **You** to upload beta versions of your app
- **Testers** to install and test on their devices
- **Feedback** to flow back to you before public launch

---

## Why Use TestFlight?

### Find Bugs Early

Real users on real devices catch issues you might miss:
- Device-specific bugs
- Edge cases in user flow
- Performance issues
- Usability problems

### Validate Your App

Before spending time on App Store submission:
- Confirm core features work
- Get user feedback on design
- Refine the experience

### Build Excitement

Beta testers become your first fans:
- They feel invested in the app
- They'll leave early reviews
- They spread word of mouth

## What Testers See

When testers install via TestFlight:

2. **Full app functionality** — works just like the real app
3. **Feedback option** — can take screenshots and send feedback
4. **Automatic updates** — new builds install automatically

## Build Expiration

<Warning>
  TestFlight builds expire after 90 days. Testers must update to a newer build to continue testing.
</Warning>

Plan to upload new builds regularly to keep testers active.
