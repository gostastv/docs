## External Review (First Time)

The first build for external testers requires Apple review:

### What Apple Checks

- App doesn't crash on launch
- Basic functionality works
- No obvious guideline violations

### What to Provide

- **Beta App Description:** Brief description for testers
- **Feedback Email:** Where testers send feedback
- **Contact Info:** For Apple to reach you if needed
- **Notes:** Anything Apple should know

### Review Timeline

- Usually 24-48 hours
- Can be faster or slower depending on volume

### After Approval

Subsequent builds for the same version typically don't need re-review unless:
- You significantly change the app's functionality
- You add new features that might need review
- Apple requests it

---

## Managing Tester Groups

### Creating Groups

Organize testers by purpose:

- **Friends & Family** — Close contacts for early testing
- **Power Users** — Experienced testers
- **Focus Group** — Specific demographic
- **Bug Hunters** — Technical testers

### Group Settings

Each group can have:
- Automatic distribution (new builds sent automatically)
- Specific build assignment
- Custom "What to Test" instructions

### Removing Testers

1. Go to the tester in TestFlight
2. Click "Remove" or "Delete"
3. They lose access immediately

---

## What Testers Experience

### Invitation Email

Testers receive an email from Apple with:
- App name
- Your custom message (if provided)
- "View in TestFlight" button

### Installing Your App

1. Tester downloads TestFlight app (if not already installed)
2. Clicks "Accept" on your invitation
3. Installs your app
4. App appears on home screen with orange dot

### Updates

When you upload a new build:
- Testers see "Update Available" in TestFlight
- With automatic distribution, it may auto-update
- They can always roll back to previous builds

---

## Gathering Feedback

### Built-in Feedback

Testers can:
1. Take a screenshot in your app
2. Shake device or tap TestFlight notification
3. Write feedback and send

You receive feedback in App Store Connect → TestFlight → Feedback.

### Crash Reports

When the app crashes:
- TestFlight collects crash data
- View in App Store Connect → TestFlight → Crashes
- Helps identify issues to fix

### External Feedback Channels

Consider also using:
- A feedback form in your app
- Discord or Slack channel
- Google Form or Typeform
- Direct email

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start small, then expand" icon="chart-line">
    Begin with close contacts who'll give honest feedback. Expand to larger groups after fixing initial issues.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Communicate with testers" icon="comments">
    Let testers know when new builds are available and what changed. They'll test more actively if they feel involved.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Respond to feedback" icon="reply">
    Even a simple "Thanks, we're looking into it" encourages more feedback.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set expectations" icon="clipboard-list">
    Tell testers what you want them to focus on. General "use the app" feedback is less actionable than specific questions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
