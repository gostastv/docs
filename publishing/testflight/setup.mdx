Before uploading, your app must exist in App Store Connect.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open App Store Connect">
    Go to [appstoreconnect.apple.com](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com) and sign in
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Apps">
    Click "My Apps" from the main dashboard
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create new app">
    Click the "+" button → "New App"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill in app details">
    - **Platform:** iOS
    - **Name:** Your app's display name
    - **Primary Language:** Your main language
    - **Bundle ID:** Must match your Nativeline project
    - **SKU:** Any unique identifier (e.g., "myapp-001")
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create">

## Step 2: Configure App Store Connect

### Basic Information

Once your app is created, add basic info:

1. **App Information**

   - Content Rights
   - Age Rating

2. **Pricing and Availability**

<Note>
  You don't need to complete the full App Store listing for TestFlight. Just the basics.
</Note>

### Privacy Policy

Apple requires a privacy policy URL for all apps:

1. Create a privacy policy (many free generators online)
2. Host it somewhere (your website, Notion page, etc.)
3. Add the URL in App Store Connect → App Information → Privacy Policy URL

---

## Step 3: Configure TestFlight

### Navigate to TestFlight

In App Store Connect:
1. Click on your app
2. Select "TestFlight" tab

### Set Up Test Information

For external testing, you'll need:

- **Beta App Description:** What testers should know
- **Beta App Review Information:** Contact info for Apple review
- **What to Test:** Instructions for testers

### Create a Tester Group (Optional)

Organize testers into groups:

1. Click "+" next to "External Groups"
2. Name your group (e.g., "Beta Testers")
3. Add testers to this group later

## Step 4: Connect Nativeline to App Store Connect

### Enable App Store Connect Integration

In Nativeline:

1. Open your project
2. Click the **plane icon** (✈️) in the top-right toolbar
3. Click **Connect to App Store Connect** when prompted
4. Sign in with your Apple Developer Apple ID
5. Select your team (if multiple)

### Verify Connection

Once connected, you should see:

## Step 5: Prepare Your App

### Finalize Your App

Before uploading, ensure:

- [ ] App is working and tested in Simulator
- [ ] No obvious crashes or bugs
- [ ] Version number is set (e.g., 1.0.0)
- [ ] Build number is set (e.g., 1)

### Update Version Information

In Nativeline Settings → App Identity:

|-------|-------------|---------|
| Version | User-facing version | 1.0.0 |
| Build | Increments with each upload | 1, 2, 3... |

<Note>
  Build numbers must always increase. If you upload build 5, your next upload must be 6 or higher.
</Note>

## Step 6: Upload Your First Build

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start the upload">
    Click the **plane icon** (✈️) in the top-right toolbar
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review settings">
    Confirm version, build number, and signing configuration
  </Step>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for processing">
    App Store Connect processes your build (10-30 minutes)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Happens After Upload

### Processing

Apple processes your build:
- Validates the binary
- Checks for required assets
- Scans for issues

You'll see status in App Store Connect:
- "Processing" → Wait
- "Ready to Submit" → You can add testers

### If Processing Fails

Check for:
- Missing app icon
- Invalid provisioning
- Bundle ID mismatch

## Post-Setup Checklist

After completing setup:

- [ ] App exists in App Store Connect
- [ ] Bundle ID matches between Nativeline and App Store Connect
- [ ] First build uploaded and processed
- [ ] Build shows "Ready to Submit" in TestFlight tab
