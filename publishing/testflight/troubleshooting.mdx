# TestFlight Troubleshooting

Running into issues with TestFlight? Here are solutions to the most common problems.

## Upload Issues

### "Invalid Binary" Error

**Symptoms:** Upload succeeds but email says "Invalid Binary"

**Common causes and fixes:**

| Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Missing app icon | Add 1024x1024 PNG icon in Settings → App Identity |
| Wrong provisioning | Reset signing certificates in Settings → Signing |
| Duplicate build number | Increment build number and re-upload |
| Missing Info.plist keys | Let Nativeline regenerate the project |

### Upload Gets Stuck

**Symptoms:** Progress bar doesn't move for extended time

**Fixes:**
1. Wait at least 30 minutes (large apps take time)
2. Check internet connection
3. Cancel and retry
4. Try during off-peak hours
5. Restart Nativeline and try again

### "Unable to Upload"

**Symptoms:** Upload fails immediately

**Check:**
- [ ] Signed into App Store Connect in Nativeline
- [ ] Developer Program is active (not expired)
- [ ] Internet connection is stable
- [ ] App exists in App Store Connect with matching Bundle ID

---

## Processing Issues

### Stuck on "Processing"

**Symptoms:** Build shows "Processing" for hours

**Normal:** Processing can take 30 minutes to 2 hours

**If longer:**
1. Check [Apple System Status](https://developer.apple.com/system-status/)
2. Wait up to 24 hours (rare cases)
3. Upload a new build with incremented number

### "Missing Compliance"

**Symptoms:** Build processed but shows "Missing Compliance"

**Fix:**
1. In App Store Connect, click on the build
2. Answer the export compliance question
3. Typically: Yes, uses HTTPS only → Select exempt

**Permanent fix:**
Ask Nativeline:
```
Set export compliance to no custom encryption
```

This adds the key to Info.plist so you don't have to answer each time.

### "Build Invalid"

**Symptoms:** Email says build is invalid with specific error

**Common errors:**

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| ITMS-90683: Missing Purpose String | Add usage descriptions in Settings → Permissions |
| ITMS-90024: Info.plist error | Regenerate project files |
| ITMS-90096: Bundle ID mismatch | Match Bundle ID in Nativeline and App Store Connect |
| ITMS-90171: Invalid certificate | Reset certificates in Settings → Signing |

   - What device/iOS version?
   - Does it happen every time?

3. **Review Console Logs** (Pro feature)
   - Open Code Editor in Nativeline
   - Check Logs tab for error messages

### Common Crash Causes
