# External APIs

External APIs let you add specialized functionality to your app — AI capabilities, payment processing, weather data, and more.

## What Are External APIs?

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) let your app communicate with external services:

```
Your App → HTTP Request → External Service
                              ↓
Your App ← Response Data ← External Service
```

## How API Integration Works

### 1. Get API Credentials

Most APIs require authentication:
- **API Key** — A secret string identifying your app
- **OAuth** — User-authorized access (for user data)

### 2. Configure in App

Tell Nativeline about the API:
```
Add OpenAI integration with API key: sk-xxxxx
```

### 3. Make Requests

The AI handles the technical details. You describe what you want:
```
When user taps "Generate", send their text to OpenAI
and display the response.
```

## API Security

<Warning>
  Never expose API keys in your code or share them publicly. Keys give access to your account and can incur charges.
</Warning>

### Nativeline Security

Nativeline stores API keys securely:
- Encrypted in macOS Keychain
- Not committed to source code
- Not visible in compiled app (properly)

### Best Practices

- Use environment variables when possible
- Rotate keys if exposed
- Set spending limits in API dashboards
- Consider server-side proxies for production

---

## Common API Patterns

### Request-Response

Most APIs follow this pattern:

```swift
// 1. Build request with data
let request = OpenAIRequest(prompt: userInput)

// 2. Send to API
let response = try await openAI.complete(request)

// 3. Use the response
displayResult(response.text)
```

### Handling Errors

APIs can fail — handle errors gracefully:

```
Handle API errors:
- Network errors: Show "Check your connection"
- Rate limits: Show "Please wait and try again"
- Invalid key: Show "Configuration error"
```

### Loading States

Show progress while waiting for responses:

```
While waiting for the API response:
- Show loading indicator
- Disable the send button
- Show progress text like "Thinking..."
```

## Free vs Paid APIs

### Typically Free

- Apple Maps (built-in)
- WeatherKit (with Apple Developer account)
- Many APIs have free tiers

### Typically Paid (with free tiers)

| API | Free Tier |
|-----|-----------|
| OpenAI | $5 credit for new accounts |
| Stripe | Free until you process payments |
| Google Maps | $200/month credit |
| OpenWeather | 1,000 calls/day |

### Cost Considerations

- Monitor usage in API dashboards
- Set spending limits
- Cache responses to reduce calls
- Use rate limiting in your app
