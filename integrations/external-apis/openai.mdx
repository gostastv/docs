## OpenAI Models

| Model | Best For | Speed | Cost |
|-------|----------|-------|------|
| `gpt-4o` | Complex tasks, reasoning | Medium | Higher |
| `gpt-4o-mini` | Simple tasks, chat | Fast | Lower |
| `gpt-3.5-turbo` | Basic chat, cost-sensitive | Fast | Lowest |

### Choosing a Model

```
Use gpt-4o-mini for the chat feature (fast and affordable)
```

---

## API Parameters

### Temperature

Controls randomness (0 = focused, 1 = creative):

```
Use temperature 0.7 for creative writing
Use temperature 0.3 for factual Q&A
```

### Max Tokens

Limits response length:

```
Limit responses to 500 tokens to keep them concise
```

### System Prompt

Sets the AI's behavior:

```
Add a system prompt:
"You are a helpful cooking assistant. Answer questions about recipes,
ingredients, and cooking techniques. Be concise and friendly."
```

---

## Example Use Cases

### Chatbot

```
Create a customer service chatbot that:
- Greets users
- Answers FAQs about [your topic]
- Asks clarifying questions
- Suggests related topics
```

### Content Generator

```
Build a blog post generator:
- User enters topic
- Select tone (professional, casual, humorous)
- Generate outline first
- Then expand each section
- Allow regeneration of sections
```

### Summarizer

```
Add a summarize feature:
- User pastes long text
- Tap "Summarize"
- Show condensed version
- Option for bullet points vs paragraph
```

### Writing Assistant

```
Create a writing assistant:
- Text editor for user's draft
- "Improve" button to polish text
- "Expand" button to add detail
- "Simplify" button for clarity
```

---

## Handling Conversations

### Maintaining Context

Include conversation history for context:

```
Send the full conversation history to OpenAI so it
understands the context of the conversation.
```

### Trimming History

For long conversations, trim old messages:

```
Keep the last 10 messages in history to stay within
token limits while maintaining context.
```

---

## Error Handling

### Common Errors

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Invalid API key | Wrong or expired key | Check key in OpenAI dashboard |
| Rate limited | Too many requests | Wait and retry with backoff |
| Insufficient quota | Out of credits | Add credits in OpenAI billing |
| Context too long | Too many tokens | Trim conversation history |

### Handling in App

```
Handle OpenAI errors gracefully:
- Rate limit: "Please wait a moment"
- Network error: "Check your connection"
- Other errors: "Something went wrong, try again"
Show retry button after errors.
```

---

## Cost Management

### Monitoring Usage

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Write good system prompts" icon="pen">
    Clear system prompts improve results:
    - Define the AI's role
    - Specify tone and style
    - Set boundaries
    - Include examples
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Handle rate limits" icon="gauge-high">
    Implement exponential backoff:
    - Wait 1 second, retry
    - If fails, wait 2 seconds
    - Then 4, 8, etc.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Show loading states" icon="spinner">
    API calls take time. Show:
    - Loading indicator
    - "Thinking..." message
    - Disable send button
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Validate inputs" icon="check">
    Check user input before sending:
    - Not empty
    - Within length limits
    - No obvious abuse
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced: Streaming

For longer responses, stream tokens as they arrive:

```
Stream the AI response so text appears word by word
instead of waiting for the complete response.
```

This provides better UX for longer generations.

---

## DALL-E (Image Generation)

OpenAI also offers image generation:

```
Add image generation:
- User enters description
- Generate image with DALL-E
- Display the result
- Option to save or regenerate
```

<Note>
  DALL-E has separate pricing. Check OpenAI pricing page for current rates.
