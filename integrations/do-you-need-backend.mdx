# Do You Need a Backend?

Not every app needs a backend or cloud services. This guide helps you decide what your app actually needs.

## Quick Decision Flow

```
Does your app need user accounts?
├── Yes → You need Supabase (Auth + Database)
└── No
    ├── Does data need to sync across devices?
    │   ├── Yes → You need Supabase
    │   └── No
    │       ├── Does data need to persist when app is deleted?
    │       │   ├── Yes → Consider Supabase or iCloud
    │       │   └── No → Local storage is fine (SwiftData)
    │       └── Do you need external data (weather, AI, etc.)?
    │           ├── Yes → You need specific APIs
    │           └── No → No backend needed!
```

## When You DON'T Need a Backend

### Apps That Work Completely Offline

These apps store everything locally:
- Personal calculators
- Unit converters
- Simple note apps (single device)
- Timers and stopwatches
- Single-player games
- Personal habit trackers (single device)
- Shopping lists (single device)

### Built-in iOS Features

These features don't require external services:
- Camera and Photos
- Calendar integration (via iOS Calendar)
- Contacts (via iOS Contacts)
- Reminders (via iOS Reminders)
- HealthKit data (stored by iOS)
- Core Location (GPS)
- Local notifications

## When You DO Need a Backend

### User Accounts

If your app needs:
- Signup / Login
- User profiles
- Private user data
- Social features

**Solution:** Supabase Authentication

### Cloud Data Storage

If your app needs:
- Data that syncs between devices
- Data accessible from web/other platforms
- Data stored even if app is deleted
- Shared data between users

**Solution:** Supabase Database

### File Uploads

If your app needs:
- Profile photo uploads
- User-generated content (images, documents)
- Media sharing between users

**Solution:** Supabase Storage

### Real-Time Features

If your app needs:
- Live chat
- Collaborative editing
- Live activity feeds
- Instant notifications of changes

**Solution:** Supabase Realtime

### External Data or Functionality

| Need | Solution |
|------|----------|
| AI / ChatGPT features | OpenAI API |
| Payment processing | Stripe |
| Weather data | WeatherKit or OpenWeather |
| Email sending | SendGrid, Mailgun |
| SMS sending | Twilio |
| Push notifications | Apple APNS (via Supabase or Firebase) |

## Local Storage vs Cloud Storage

### Local Storage (SwiftData)

**Pros:**
- Works offline
- Fast (no network latency)
- Free (no external service)
- Private (data stays on device)

**Cons:**
- Lost if app is deleted
- Single device only
- No sharing between users

**Best for:**
- Personal productivity apps
- Single-device tools
- Offline-first apps

### Cloud Storage (Supabase)

**Pros:**
- Syncs across devices
- Survives app deletion
- Can share between users
- Accessible from web

**Cons:**
- Requires internet
- Has network latency
- Costs money at scale
- More complex

**Best for:**
- Social apps
- Multi-device sync
- Apps with user accounts
- Collaborative features

### Hybrid Approach

Many apps use both:
1. Store locally for speed
2. Sync to cloud for backup/multi-device
3. Work offline, sync when online

## Cost Considerations

### Free Options

| Service | Free Tier |
|---------|-----------|
| Supabase | 500MB database, 1GB storage, 50K auth users |
| OpenWeather | 1,000 calls/day |
| WeatherKit | 500K calls/month |
| Firebase | Generous free tier |

### When You'll Pay

You'll exceed free tiers when:
- Thousands of active users
- Storing lots of images/files
- Heavy API usage
- Enterprise-level needs

For most indie apps, free tiers are sufficient.

## Making Your Decision

### Start Simple

1. Build your app with local storage first
2. Get core features working
3. Add cloud features if needed

### Add Cloud Features When

- Users ask for multi-device sync
- You need user accounts
- You want social features
- Data loss concerns (cloud backup)

### Questions to Ask

1. Does my app work if the user has no internet?
2. Do users expect their data on multiple devices?
3. Do users interact with each other?
4. Is user data valuable enough to need cloud backup?

---

## Still Unsure?

### Start Local, Add Cloud Later

Most apps can start with local storage and add Supabase later. This approach:
- Gets you to market faster
- Validates your idea first
- Adds complexity only when needed

### Just Use Supabase

If you think you might need any cloud features:
- Supabase has a generous free tier
- Better to set it up early
- Easier than migrating later
