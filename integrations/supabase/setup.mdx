# Supabase Setup

This guide walks you through creating a Supabase project and connecting it to your Nativeline app.

## Prerequisites

- Nativeline installed with a project
- Email address for Supabase account

---

## Step 1: Create Supabase Account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Supabase">
    Visit [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and click **Start your project**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign up">
    Create an account with:
    - GitHub (recommended)
    - Or email/password
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify email">
    If using email, verify via the confirmation link.
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Step 2: Create a Project

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click 'New Project'">
    From the dashboard, click **New Project**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter project details">
    - **Name:** Your app name (e.g., "My Todo App")
    - **Database Password:** Generate a strong password (save this!)
    - **Region:** Choose closest to your users
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for setup">
    Takes ~2 minutes to provision your project.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Save your database password somewhere secure. You'll need it if you ever connect directly to the database.
</Warning>

---

## Step 3: Get Your Credentials

Once your project is ready:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Settings">
    Click the **Settings** icon (gear) in the sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click API">
    Select **API** from the settings menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy credentials">
    You need two things:
    - **Project URL:** `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`
    - **anon public key:** A long string starting with `eyJ...`
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  The anon key is safe to use in your app. It respects Row Level Security policies. Never use the `service_role` key in client apps.
</Note>

---

## Step 4: Connect to Nativeline

In your Nativeline chat:

```
Connect to Supabase with:
- URL: https://your-project-id.supabase.co
- Key: your-anon-key-here
```

Or go to **Settings → Database** and enter your credentials there.

Nativeline will:
1. Save your credentials securely
2. Set up the Supabase client
3. Be ready to use Supabase features

---

## Step 5: Verify Connection

Test that everything works:

```
Create a simple test to verify Supabase is connected properly.
Try to read from Supabase and log the result.
```

You should see a successful connection message in your build output.

---

## Project Structure After Setup

Nativeline creates Supabase-related files:

```
YourApp/
├── Services/
│   └── SupabaseService.swift    # Supabase client
├── Models/
│   └── (your data models)
└── ...
```

## Common Setup Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid API key" icon="key">
    - Make sure you're using the **anon** key, not service_role
    - Check for extra spaces when copying
    - Verify the key matches your project URL
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Project not found" icon="magnifying-glass">
    - Double-check the project URL
    - Ensure the project finished initializing
    - URL should be `https://xxxxx.supabase.co` (not dashboard URL)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Connection timeout" icon="clock">
    - Check your internet connection
    - Project might still be initializing (wait 2-3 minutes)
    - Try refreshing Supabase dashboard
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="CORS errors" icon="shield">
    Supabase allows requests from anywhere by default. If you see CORS errors:
    - Verify you're using the correct URL
    - Check Supabase dashboard for any restrictions
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security Best Practices

### Use Row Level Security

Always enable RLS on your tables:

1. In Supabase dashboard → Table Editor
2. Click on your table
3. Enable "RLS" toggle
4. Add policies

Without RLS, anyone with your anon key can read all data!

### Secure Credentials

Nativeline stores your credentials in:
- macOS Keychain (encrypted)
- Not in your source code

Never commit credentials to git or share them publicly.

### Minimal Permissions

Only enable the Supabase features you need. Don't enable Storage if you're only using Auth.
