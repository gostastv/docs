# Glossary

Terms you'll encounter while using Nativeline, explained in plain English.

---

## A

### API (Application Programming Interface)
A way for software to talk to other software. When your app saves data to Supabase, it uses Supabase's API.

### App Store Connect
Apple's website for managing your apps on the App Store and TestFlight. You'll use this to add testers and submit your app.

### Archive
A packaged version of your app ready for distribution. Nativeline creates an archive before uploading to TestFlight.

---

## B

### Bits
Your monthly AI usage budget in Nativeline. More complex tasks use more bits. Different plans include different amounts of bits.

### Build
The process of compiling your Swift code into a runnable app. When a build succeeds, your app can run in the Simulator.

### Bundle Identifier
A unique identifier for your app, like `com.yourname.myapp`. This tells iOS "this is a specific app" and must be unique worldwide.

---

## C

### Capability
A special iOS feature your app can use, like push notifications, HealthKit, or Sign in with Apple. These must be enabled in project settings.

### Code Editor
A feature (Pro plan and above) that lets you view and edit your app's Swift code directly.

### Context
The information the AI knows about your project - what the app does, recent changes, patterns used, etc.

---

## D

### Deployment
The process of publishing your app to TestFlight or the App Store.

### Derived Data
Temporary files Xcode creates during builds. Sometimes clearing derived data fixes stubborn build issues.

---

## F

### Framework
Pre-written code that provides common functionality. SwiftUI is a framework for building user interfaces.

---

## I

### IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
A program for writing code. Xcode is Apple's IDE. Nativeline uses Xcode behind the scenes.

### iOS
Apple's operating system for iPhones and iPads. Your Nativeline apps run on iOS.

---

## J

### JWT (JSON Web Token)
A secure way to prove identity. Your app uses JWTs when communicating with Supabase.

---

## M

### macOS
Apple's operating system for Mac computers. Nativeline runs on macOS.

### Migration
A change to your database structure - like adding a new column or table. Migrations track these changes over time.

### Model
In code, a structure that represents data. A `Task` model might have properties like `title`, `dueDate`, and `isCompleted`.

---

## O

### Observable
A Swift pattern that automatically updates your UI when data changes. Nativeline uses `@Observable` for state management.

---

## P

### Permission
Authorization your app needs to access device features. Camera, location, and photos are common permissions.

### Plan
A step-by-step list of tasks the AI creates before implementing a feature. You see this as a todo list in the chat. Plans persist until completed or cleared with `/planclear`.

### /planclear
A command you can type in chat to clear the current plan and start fresh. Useful when you want to abandon an existing plan.

### Provisioning Profile
Apple's way of authorizing your app to run on specific devices. Nativeline handles this automatically for Simulator builds.

---

## R

### Row Level Security (RLS)
A Supabase feature that controls which rows users can see and modify. Essential for keeping user data private.

---

## S

### SDK (Software Development Kit)
A collection of tools for building apps for a specific platform. The iOS SDK lets you build iPhone apps.

### Simulator
A virtual iPhone/iPad that runs on your Mac. Used for testing apps without a physical device.

### Supabase
A cloud service that provides databases, authentication, and storage. Nativeline integrates with Supabase for backend features.

### Swift
Apple's programming language for building iOS apps. All Nativeline apps are written in Swift.

### SwiftData
Apple's framework for storing data locally on the device. Great for offline apps.

### SwiftUI
Apple's modern framework for building user interfaces. All Nativeline apps use SwiftUI.

---

## T

### TestFlight
Apple's service for distributing beta versions of apps. Users install TestFlight from the App Store to test your app.

### Tool Card
A visual indicator in the chat showing that the AI is reading, creating, or editing a file.

---

## U

### UI (User Interface)
The visual parts of your app that users see and interact with - buttons, text, images, etc.

### UUID (Universally Unique Identifier)
A unique ID like `123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000`. Used to identify specific records in databases.

---

## V

### View
A building block of UI in SwiftUI. Buttons, text, images, and screens are all views.

### ViewModel
Code that manages data and logic for a view. Keeps your views focused on display.

---

## X

### Xcode
Apple's official app for building iOS apps. Nativeline uses Xcode behind the scenes to compile your app.

---

## Symbols

### .nativeline
A hidden folder in your project containing the AI's memory - what it knows about your app, conversation history, and active plans.

### .p8
A private key file from Apple used for API authentication. You download this from App Store Connect for TestFlight deployment and push notifications.

### .xcodeproj
The Xcode project file that contains your app's configuration and file references.
