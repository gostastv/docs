# Best Practices

These tips come from experienced Nativeline users. Follow them to build better apps faster and use your bits more efficiently.

## Building Strategy

### Start Simple, Iterate Often

<Steps>
  <Step title="Build the core first">
    Get the most important feature working before anything else
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test immediately">
    Check it works in the Simulator before moving on
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add one thing at a time">
    Each new feature should build on a working foundation
  </Step>
  <Step title="Polish later">
    Save the visual refinements for after core features work
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  **Good approach:**
  1. "Create a task list where I can add items" → Test it
  2. "Add the ability to mark tasks complete" → Test it
  3. "Add due dates" → Test it
  4. "Make the cards look nicer with shadows" → Test it
</Check>

<Warning>
  **Risky approach:**
  "Build a complete task manager with categories, due dates, priorities, reminders, sync, and beautiful animations"
  → Too many things can go wrong at once
</Warning>

### Test After Every Change

Don't batch multiple features before testing. If something breaks, you won't know which change caused it.

The Simulator is there for a reason - use it constantly!

### One Feature Per Message

Break complex requests into focused messages:

| Instead of... | Try... |
|--------------|--------|
| "Add settings, profile, and notifications" | "Add a settings screen" → "Add a profile screen" → "Add notifications" |
| "Make it look better with animations and colors" | "Add subtle animations to buttons" → "Update the color scheme to blue" |

## Prompt Optimization

### Be Specific Upfront

Vague prompts lead to guesswork. Guesswork leads to corrections. Corrections use bits.

| Vague (costs more bits) | Specific (saves bits) |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| "Change the color" | "Change the header background to #FF6B35" |
| "Make it bigger" | "Increase the font size to 24pt" |
| "Add a button" | "Add a 'Save' button below the form with green background" |

### Describe the User Experience

Instead of implementation details, describe what users see and do:

> "When users tap a task, show a detail screen with the task title at the top, description in the middle, and a 'Mark Complete' button at the bottom"

This gives the AI context to make good implementation decisions.

### Include Edge Cases

> "Add a task list. When the list is empty, show 'No tasks yet - tap + to add one' with a friendly illustration"

Thinking about edge cases upfront prevents "oh wait, what about..." messages later.

## Saving Bits

### Combine Related Changes

If you need several related changes, mention them together:

> "Update the button styling across the app: make them all have 16pt corner radius, a subtle shadow, and use the blue accent color"

This is more efficient than:
- "Change button corners to 16pt" (50 bits)
- "Add shadows to buttons" (50 bits)
- "Make buttons blue" (50 bits)

### Use Images

A screenshot is worth hundreds of bits. Instead of describing a complex design:

> "Make my app look like this" + [attached screenshot]

The AI understands visual context better than textual descriptions of layouts.

### Use the Code Editor (Pro Plan)

For tiny changes, edit code directly:
- Fixing typos
- Changing color values
- Adjusting padding
- Minor text changes

This uses zero bits!

## Project Organization

### Keep Context Clean

The AI remembers your project, but too much context slows things down:

- Clear conversations when starting fresh work
- The AI will still know your project from context files
- Fresh conversations are faster and cheaper

### Back Up Your Projects

Your projects live in `~/Documents/Nativeline Projects/`. Back them up:

- Time Machine (automatic if enabled)
- iCloud Drive
- Manual copies before big changes
- Git if you're comfortable with version control

### Use Consistent Naming

Consistency helps the AI understand your project:

<Check>
  **Consistent:**
  - `HomeView`, `SettingsView`, `ProfileView`
  - `TaskModel`, `UserModel`, `CategoryModel`
  - `createTask()`, `updateTask()`, `deleteTask()`
</Check>

<Warning>
  **Inconsistent:**
  - `Home`, `SettingsScreen`, `ProfilePage`
  - `TaskModel`, `userInfo`, `category_data`
  - `newTask()`, `modifyUser()`, `removeItem()`
</Warning>

## Debugging Strategy

### Let the AI Try First

When builds fail:
1. Wait for the automatic fix attempt
2. Give it 2-3 tries
3. Only intervene if it's stuck

The AI learns from errors and often fixes them faster than you'd expect.

### Describe Problems, Not Solutions

If you need to intervene:

<Check>
  **Good:**
  "The task list shows 'Loading...' forever even though I have data in the database"
</Check>

<Warning>
  **Less helpful:**
  "Change the fetchTasks function to use await instead of callbacks"
</Warning>

Let the AI diagnose - it might find a different root cause.

### Simplify to Isolate

If a feature isn't working:
1. Remove the complex parts temporarily
2. Test the simple version
3. Add complexity back gradually
4. Find where it breaks

## Working with the AI

### Trust the Process

The four phases (Understand → Plan → Build → Verify) work. Let them complete before making new requests.

### Interrupt Strategically

Good times to interrupt:
- You see the plan and it's wrong
- The AI is about to do something you don't want
- You have important context to add

Bad times to interrupt:
- Mid-build (let it finish)
- After each small step (too disruptive)
- To make tiny adjustments (save for later)

### Keep a Running Wishlist

As you test, note things you want to change:
- "Make header sticky"
- "Add pull-to-refresh"
- "Button needs more padding"

Then request them in batches after the current feature is complete.

## Performance Tips

### Don't Over-Optimize Early

Focus on functionality first. Optimize only when:
- Something is noticeably slow
- The Simulator is struggling
- You're ready for TestFlight

### Test on Real Devices

Before publishing:
1. Deploy to TestFlight
2. Test on your actual iPhone
3. The Simulator isn't a perfect representation

### Keep Data Loads Reasonable

For initial development:
- Test with small datasets (10-50 items)
- Increase gradually
- Add pagination for large lists

## Publishing Checklist

Before going to TestFlight:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Features complete">
    All planned features work correctly
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edge cases handled">
    Empty states, errors, loading states
  </Step>
  <Step title="Design polished">
    Consistent spacing, colors, fonts
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tested on Simulator">
    Works on both small (SE) and large (Pro Max) screens
  </Step>
  <Step title="Settings configured">
    App name, icon, version, permissions
  </Step>
  <Step title="No crashes">
    Run through the entire app without crashes
  </Step>
</Steps>
