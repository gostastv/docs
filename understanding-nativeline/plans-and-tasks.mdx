# Plans and Tasks

When you ask Nativeline to build something, the AI doesn't just start coding. It first creates a plan - a structured list of tasks that guides the implementation. Understanding this process helps you work more effectively with the AI.

## The Planning Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="You make a request">
    "Add a settings screen with theme toggle and notification preferences"
  </Step>
  <Step title="AI analyzes the request">
    Breaks down what's needed: new screen, navigation, multiple settings sections
  </Step>
  <Step title="Plan is created">
    A step-by-step task list appears in your chat
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tasks are executed">
    Each task is completed one by one
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build and verify">
    After all tasks, the app builds and you see the result
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The Todo List

When the AI creates a plan, you'll see a **todo list** appear in the chat:

```
📋 Plan: Add Settings Screen

□ Create SettingsView.swift with basic structure
□ Add navigation link from Profile to Settings
□ Build Account section with user info display
□ Build Notifications section with toggle options
□ Build Appearance section with theme picker
□ Add sign out button with confirmation
```

As tasks complete, they're checked off:

```
📋 Plan: Add Settings Screen

✓ Create SettingsView.swift with basic structure
✓ Add navigation link from Profile to Settings
▶ Build Account section with user info display
□ Build Notifications section with toggle options
□ Build Appearance section with theme picker
□ Add sign out button with confirmation
```

### Reading the Todo List

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| □ | Pending - not yet started |
| ▶ | In progress - currently working on |
| ✓ | Completed - done |
| ✗ | Failed - encountered an error |

## Why Plans Matter

### Visibility

You can see exactly what the AI is doing. No black box - every step is visible.

### Predictability

You know what's coming next. If you see a step you don't want, you can interrupt and clarify.

### Resumability

If something interrupts your session, the plan is saved. The AI can continue from where it left off.

### Quality

Planning before coding leads to better results. The AI thinks through the approach before writing code.

## The Plan File

Plans are saved to `.nativeline/plans/active.md`. Here's what that looks like:

```markdown
# Current Plan: Add Settings Screen

## What I'll Build
A settings screen with three sections: Account (view user info),
Notifications (toggle preferences), and Appearance (theme selection).
Also includes a sign out button.

## Files to Modify
- Views/ProfileView.swift (add navigation link)
- App.swift (ensure NavigationStack is present)

## Files to Create
- Views/SettingsView.swift
- Views/Settings/AccountSection.swift
- Views/Settings/NotificationsSection.swift
- Views/Settings/AppearanceSection.swift

## Steps
- [x] Create SettingsView.swift with basic structure
- [x] Add navigation link from Profile to Settings
- [ ] Build Account section with user info display
- [ ] Build Notifications section with toggle options
- [ ] Build Appearance section with theme picker
- [ ] Add sign out button with confirmation

## Context
User has existing Profile screen with avatar and name.
App uses @Observable pattern for state management.
Design follows dark theme with orange accent color.

## Status
In Progress - Step 3 of 6
Started: 2024-01-15 10:30
```

## Working with Plans

### Letting the AI Work

Most of the time, just let the AI execute the plan:
1. Watch progress in the todo list
2. See files being created/edited in tool cards
3. Wait for the build
4. Test the result

### Interrupting a Plan

If you see something going wrong, you can interrupt:

> "Stop - I don't want the sign out button in settings. Put it in the profile screen instead."

The AI will adjust the plan.

### Modifying Mid-Plan

You can add requirements as the AI works:

> "Also add a 'Reset to Defaults' option at the bottom"

The AI will incorporate this into the current plan.

### Starting Over

If things go really wrong:

> "Let's start over with the settings screen. Here's what I want..."

The AI will create a new plan.

## Complex vs Simple Plans

### Simple Requests (No Visible Plan)

For very simple changes, the AI may skip the visible plan:
- "Change the button color to blue"
- "Fix the typo in the header"
- "Add 10px more padding"

These are so simple that planning would be overkill.

### Complex Requests (Detailed Plan)

For multi-step work, you'll see full plans:
- "Add a complete user profile system"
- "Create an onboarding flow"
- "Implement search with filters"

## Plans Across Sessions

If you close Nativeline mid-plan:

1. **Plan is saved** to `.nativeline/plans/active.md`
2. **When you return**, the AI notices the incomplete plan
3. **It can continue** from where it left off
4. **Or you can start fresh** with a new request

### Resuming Example

When reopening a project with an incomplete plan, you might see:

> "I see we were working on a settings screen. Should I continue where we left off, or would you like to do something else?"

## Plan Best Practices

<Check>
  **Do:**
  - Read through the plan before it executes
  - Interrupt early if something's wrong
  - Let the AI finish before major changes
  - Trust the step-by-step process
</Check>

<Warning>
  **Don't:**
  - Add new requirements mid-execution constantly
  - Interrupt for tiny adjustments
  - Expect the AI to read your mind
  - Start new features before the plan completes
</Warning>

## Understanding Plan Scope

### Well-Scoped Requests

These create clean, focused plans:
- "Add a settings screen with theme toggle"
- "Create a search bar that filters the list"
- "Add swipe-to-delete on list items"

### Poorly-Scoped Requests

These create messy, hard-to-execute plans:
- "Add a bunch of features"
- "Make the app better"
- "Add everything we discussed"

<Tip>
  **One focused request = One clean plan = Better results**
</Tip>

## When Plans Fail

Sometimes a plan step fails (code doesn't compile, feature doesn't work). When this happens:

1. **The step is marked failed** (✗)
2. **The Debugger analyzes** the error
3. **A fix is attempted** (up to 3 times)
4. **If fixed**, plan continues
5. **If not**, you're asked for help

### Helping a Failed Plan

If the AI gets stuck:
- Describe the issue in your own words
- Provide more context about what you wanted
- Suggest an alternative approach
- Or ask to skip that step
