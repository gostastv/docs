# Bits and Pricing

Nativeline uses a "bits" system to measure AI usage. Understanding bits helps you use the AI efficiently and choose the right plan for your needs.

## What Are Bits?

Bits are your monthly AI usage budget. When the AI thinks, plans, codes, and debugs, it uses bits. More complex tasks use more bits.

Think of bits like a phone plan's data - you have a monthly allowance, and different activities use different amounts.

## How Bits Are Consumed

| Activity | Approximate Bits |
|----------|------------------|
| Simple question | 5-20 bits |
| Change a color or text | 10-50 bits |
| Add a simple component | 50-150 bits |
| Create a new screen | 200-500 bits |
| Build a complex feature | 500-1,000 bits |
| Debug stubborn errors | 100-500 bits |

### Why the Range?

Bit usage varies based on:
- **Complexity** - More complex = more AI thinking
- **Specificity** - Vague requests require more back-and-forth
- **Errors** - Build failures trigger debugging (more bits)
- **Context** - Large projects need more context processing

## Example Bit Usage

### Scenario: Building a Task Manager

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial creation">
    "Create a task list app with add and complete features"
    **~500 bits** (new project setup + basic features)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add due dates">
    "Add due dates to tasks with a date picker"
    **~150 bits** (modifying existing feature)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fix a bug">
    "Tasks aren't saving when I close the app"
    **~200 bits** (debugging + fix + verify)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Polish the design">
    "Make the cards have rounded corners and shadows"
    **~50 bits** (simple styling)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add categories">
    "Add categories like Work, Personal, Shopping"
    **~300 bits** (new feature + UI + data)
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Total for this session: ~1,200 bits**

## Choosing the Right Plan

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I'm just exploring" icon="magnifying-glass">
    **Start with Builder ($25)**

    1,000 bits is enough to:
    - Create a simple app
    - Learn how Nativeline works
    - Decide if you want to continue

    You can always upgrade later.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I'm building my first real app" icon="seedling">
    **Builder or Pro ($25-50)**

    For a first app, you'll likely need 1,000-2,000 bits per month depending on:
    - App complexity
    - How specific your prompts are
    - How much iteration you do

    Pro is worth it if you want to see the code.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I'm building multiple apps" icon="layer-group">
    **Scale ($100+)**

    Building several apps or one complex app? You'll burn through 1,000 bits quickly. Scale lets you customize your bit amount.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I use AI constantly" icon="bolt">
    **BYOK ($15 + API costs)**

    If you're using Nativeline daily for serious development, BYOK is the most cost-effective. You pay:
    - $15/month to Nativeline
    - Actual API usage to Anthropic (~$0.003 per 1K tokens)

    Heavy users often spend $30-100/month total.
  </Accordion>

## Checking Your Usage

Your remaining bits are displayed in Nativeline:

1. Look in the toolbar for your bits counter
2. A visual indicator shows usage progress
3. Warning appears at 80% usage

### When Bits Run Low

At 80% usage:
- You'll see a warning
- Consider upgrading or waiting for reset

At 100% usage:
- AI features are paused
- Your app and projects remain intact
- Bits reset on your billing date

## Saving Bits

Smart usage = more building with fewer bits.

### Be Specific

<Warning>
  **Expensive:**
  "Make it look better" → AI guesses, you correct, repeat (300+ bits)
</Warning>

<Check>
  **Efficient:**
  "Add 16pt padding, rounded corners (12pt), and a subtle shadow" (50 bits)
</Check>

### Build Incrementally

<Warning>
  **Expensive:**
  "Build a complete social media app" → Huge plan, many errors (2,000+ bits)
</Warning>

<Check>
  **Efficient:**
  Build feature by feature, testing each (same result, ~1,000 bits)
</Check>

### Use Images

<Check>
  **Efficient:**
  Attach a reference screenshot with your request. Visual context saves back-and-forth.
</Check>

### Test Before Adding More

<Check>
  **Efficient:**
  Verify each feature works before moving on. Catching issues early uses fewer bits than fixing them later.
</Check>

### Pro Plan: Edit Small Things Yourself

<Check>
  **Efficient:**
  On Pro plan, use the code editor for tiny tweaks (colors, spacing, text). Save bits for bigger features.
</Check>

## Bits Reset Schedule

Bits reset monthly on your billing date:
- **Unused bits don't roll over**
- **No partial refunds** for unused bits
- **Upgrades are prorated**

## Upgrading or Downgrading

### Upgrading

1. Go to **Settings → Plans**
2. Select a higher tier
3. Confirm upgrade
4. New bits are added immediately
5. You're charged the prorated difference

### Downgrading

1. Go to **Settings → Plans**
2. Select a lower tier
3. Confirm downgrade
4. Change takes effect at next billing date
5. You keep current bits until then

<Note>
  Downgrading from Pro+ loses code editor access. Make sure you don't have unsaved edits.
</Note>

## BYOK Deep Dive

Bring Your Own Key is for users who want unlimited usage.

### How It Works

1. Get an API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
2. Enter the key in Nativeline settings
3. Pay $15/month to Nativeline (platform access)
4. Pay Anthropic directly for actual API usage

### Anthropic Pricing

| Model | Input | Output |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Claude Haiku | $0.25/M tokens | $1.25/M tokens |
| Claude Sonnet | $3/M tokens | $15/M tokens |

For reference:
- 1M tokens ≈ 750,000 words
- A typical feature request uses ~2,000-5,000 tokens
- A full session might use 50,000-200,000 tokens

### Typical BYOK Costs

| Usage Level | Monthly API Cost |
|-------------|------------------|
| Light (few hours/week) | $5-15 |
| Moderate (daily use) | $20-50 |
| Heavy (all day) | $50-100+ |

Plus the $15 Nativeline platform fee.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens to my projects if I cancel?">
    Your projects stay on your Mac. You can still open them in Xcode. You just can't use the AI features without an active plan.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I get more bits mid-month?">
    Yes! Upgrade to a higher tier to get more bits immediately.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why did that request use so many bits?">
    Complex requests with errors use more bits. Try being more specific or breaking into smaller requests.
