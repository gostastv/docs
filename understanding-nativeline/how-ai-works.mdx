# How the AI Works

Nativeline's AI is your development partner. While you focus on what you want to build, it handles all the technical complexity behind the scenes.

## Your AI Development Partner

When you describe what you want, Nativeline doesn't just generate code randomly. It thoughtfully:

1. **Understands your vision** - What are you trying to build? What should users experience?
2. **Creates a plan** - Breaks down your request into manageable steps
3. **Builds it carefully** - Writes production-quality Swift code
4. **Verifies everything works** - Catches and fixes errors automatically

This means you get reliable results, not random code that might or might not work.

## What This Means for You

### Your Project is Understood

The AI doesn't start fresh every time you chat. It remembers:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Your App's Purpose" icon="lightbulb">
    What your app does and who it's for
  </Card>
  <Card title="Design Decisions" icon="palette">
    Colors, styles, and layout patterns you've chosen
  </Card>
  <Card title="Code Patterns" icon="code">
    How your project is organized and structured
  </Card>
  <Card title="Past Conversations" icon="comments">
    What you've built together and decisions made
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

This context means you can say "add another screen like the settings page" and the AI knows exactly what you mean.

### Plans Keep You Informed

Before the AI starts building, you'll see a **plan** - a checklist of what it's going to do. This gives you:

- **Visibility** into what's happening
- **Opportunity** to correct course before work begins
- **Confidence** that nothing is being missed

Watch the checkboxes get ticked off as each step completes.

### Errors Fix Themselves

When code doesn't compile (a normal part of development), the AI:

1. Detects the error automatically
2. Analyzes what went wrong
3. Fixes the issue
4. Rebuilds and verifies

Most errors are fixed without you even noticing. For stubborn issues, you might see a message about what's being fixed - but you rarely need to do anything.

### It Gets Better at Your Project

The more you work together, the more the AI understands:

- Your preferred coding style
- Patterns that work well in your app
- Design choices you like
- How different parts of your app connect

This means later requests are often faster and more accurate than early ones.

## The Experience

Here's what building with Nativeline actually feels like:

<Steps>
  <Step title="You describe what you want">
    "Add a settings screen where users can toggle dark mode and notifications"
  </Step>
  <Step title="A plan appears">
    You see a checklist: Create SettingsView, add navigation, build toggle options, connect to preferences...
  </Step>
  <Step title="Work happens automatically">
    Watch as files are created and the checklist items complete
  </Step>
  <Step title="Your app updates">
    The iOS Simulator shows your new settings screen, ready to test
  </Step>
</Steps>

If something goes wrong at any step, the AI handles it. You just describe what you want and test the results.

## When to Help the AI

While the AI handles most things automatically, you can help it succeed by:

### Being Specific

<Check>
  "Add a blue button with rounded corners at the bottom of the screen"
</Check>

<Warning>
  "Add a button" (Where? What color? What style?)
</Warning>

### Describing the User Experience

<Check>
  "When users tap the heart icon, it should fill in red and save to their favorites"
</Check>

<Warning>
  "Add favorites" (How does it work? What's the interaction?)
</Warning>

### Providing Visual References

Attach screenshots or mockups when describing complex designs. A picture often communicates more than words.

## Your Projects Stay Private

Everything the AI knows about your project stays on your Mac:

- Project files are stored locally in `~/Documents/Nativeline Projects/`
- Conversation history is saved with your project
- Nothing is uploaded to the cloud unless you choose to connect a database

The AI's "memory" of your project exists as files on your computer that you control.
