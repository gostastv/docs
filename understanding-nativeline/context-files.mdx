# Your AI's Memory

One of Nativeline's most powerful features is that it remembers. When you close the app and come back later, the AI picks up right where you left off.

## What the AI Remembers

### Your Project

The AI knows what you're building:

- **What your app does** - Its purpose, features, and who it's for
- **How it's organized** - Where different pieces of code live
- **Your preferences** - Design choices, patterns you like, decisions you've made

This means you don't have to explain your app every time. The AI already knows.

### Your Conversation

Every message you've exchanged is saved:

- Scroll up to see previous conversations
- Reference past requests ("like we did before")
- The AI uses past context to inform new work

### Ongoing Work

If you're in the middle of building something:

- Active plans stay active
- Progress is tracked
- You can resume anytime

## What This Means for You

### Seamless Continuity

Close Nativeline, take a break, come back tomorrow - everything is exactly as you left it. The conversation, the plan, the progress.

### Better Suggestions

The more you work together, the smarter the AI gets about your specific project:

- It learns your coding patterns
- It remembers what worked before
- It avoids past mistakes

### No Repetition Needed

You never have to re-explain:

- "Remember, my app is a habit tracker" - It already knows
- "Use the same style as before" - It will
- "Continue what we started" - It can

## When to Start Fresh

Sometimes you want the AI to forget and start over. You might want this if:

- The conversation has become confusing
- You want to try a completely different approach
- Something seems stuck in a loop

To start fresh, simply clear the conversation. Your code stays intact - only the AI's memory of your conversation is cleared.

<Tip>
  Starting fresh doesn't delete your app or code - just the conversation history. The AI will quickly relearn your project from the code itself.
</Tip>

## Technical Details (Advanced)

For power users curious about how this works:

Your project contains a hidden `.nativeline` folder with files that store the AI's memory. You can view these files by pressing **Cmd+Shift+.** in Finder to show hidden files.

<Warning>
  These files are managed automatically by Nativeline. Editing them manually is not recommended and may cause issues.
