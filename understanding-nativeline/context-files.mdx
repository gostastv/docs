# Context Files

Nativeline maintains a hidden `.nativeline` directory in each project. These files help the AI remember your project's structure, recent work, and important decisions across sessions.

## The .nativeline Directory

Every Nativeline project contains a hidden folder:

```
YourProject/
├── Views/
├── Models/
├── Services/
├── .nativeline/          ← Hidden directory
│   ├── project.md        ← Project context
│   ├── memory.md         ← Working memory
│   ├── chat_history.json ← Conversation history
│   └── plans/
│       └── active.md     ← Current plan
└── YourProject.xcodeproj
```

<Note>
  These files are hidden by default in Finder. To see them, press **Cmd+Shift+.** in Finder to show hidden files.
</Note>

## project.md - Project Context

This file contains everything the AI knows about your app. It's loaded at the start of every session.

### What's Inside

```markdown
# Project Context

## About This App
A habit tracking app that helps users build daily routines
through streak counting and gentle reminders.

## Key Directories
- Views/ - SwiftUI views and screens
- Models/ - Data structures (Habit, Streak, Reminder)
- Services/ - Database and notification services

## Tech Standards
- Swift 6.1+, iOS 18+
- @Observable for state management
- SwiftData for persistence
- async/await for concurrency

## Important Notes
- User requested dark mode as default
- Streaks reset at midnight local time
- Notifications require user permission

## Database (Supabase)
- habits table: id, name, frequency, created_at
- streaks table: habit_id, date, completed
- RLS enabled for user isolation
```

### Why It Matters

This file ensures the AI:
- Knows what your app does
- Understands the code structure
- Follows consistent patterns
- Remembers your preferences

### When It Updates

The project context is updated:
- When significant new features are added
- When you change architectural decisions
- During context compaction (when memory gets full)

## memory.md - Working Memory

This is the AI's short-term memory - what it's currently working on and recent decisions.

### What's Inside

```markdown
# Working Memory

## Current Task
Adding notification settings screen with toggle for each habit

## Recent Decisions
1. Using UserDefaults for notification preferences (simpler than database)
2. Notification times stored per-habit, not globally
3. Toggle animations use 0.2s spring

## Patterns Observed
- All settings use SettingsRow component with toggle
- Colors follow NL.Color namespace
- Sheets use .presentationDetents([.medium])

## Lessons Learned
- Don't use 'description' as a property name (Swift reserved)
- Always add Spacer() inside HStack for alignment
- Check for existing imports before adding

## Last Session Summary
Completed: Profile screen with avatar upload
In progress: Settings screen
Next: Notification permissions flow
```

### Why It Matters

Working memory helps the AI:
- Continue where it left off
- Avoid repeating mistakes
- Follow patterns you've established
- Remember recent context

### When It Updates

Memory updates:
- After significant actions complete
- When patterns are discovered
- During context compaction
- At session end

## chat_history.json - Conversation History

Your entire conversation is saved so you can continue seamlessly.

### What's Stored

- All your messages
- All AI responses
- Tool executions (file edits, builds)
- Todo list progress
- Timestamps

### Why It Matters

When you reopen a project:
- The conversation is restored
- You can scroll back to see history
- The AI has context from previous sessions

<Tip>
  The conversation history persists even after closing Nativeline. Your progress is never lost.
</Tip>

## plans/active.md - Current Plan

When the AI creates a plan, it's stored here.

### What's Inside

```markdown
# Current Plan: Add Settings Screen

## What I'll Build
Settings screen with sections for Account, Notifications, and Appearance

## Steps
- [x] Create SettingsView.swift with basic structure
- [x] Add navigation from Profile to Settings
- [ ] Build Account section with email display
- [ ] Build Notifications section with toggles
- [ ] Build Appearance section with theme picker
- [ ] Add sign out button with confirmation

## Status: In Progress
Started: 2024-01-15 10:30
Current Step: 3 of 6
```

### Why It Matters

Plans provide:
- Visibility into what the AI is doing
- A checklist of remaining work
- Ability to resume interrupted work

### When It Updates

- Items checked off as they're completed
- New steps added if scope changes
- Archived when plan completes

## What Happens If You Delete These Files?

| File Deleted | Consequence |
|--------------|-------------|
| project.md | AI loses project understanding, recreates from code analysis |
| memory.md | AI forgets recent patterns and decisions |
| chat_history.json | Conversation history cleared, starts fresh |
| plans/active.md | Current plan lost, may recreate if you repeat request |
| Entire .nativeline/ | Full reset - AI starts from scratch |

<Warning>
  Deleting `.nativeline/` won't break your app, but the AI will lose all context and may make inconsistent decisions until it relearns your project.
</Warning>

## Context Compaction

When the AI's context gets too large (approaching limits), it "compacts" - summarizing older information to make room for new context.

### What Gets Compacted

- Old conversation messages → Summarized
- Detailed code snippets → Reduced to file references
- Resolved plans → Archived

### What's Preserved

- Project context (project.md)
- Key decisions and patterns (memory.md)
- Active plan (plans/active.md)

### When It Happens

Compaction triggers at ~95% context capacity. You may see a message like:

> "Compacting context to make room for new work..."

This is normal and helps maintain performance.

## Viewing Context Files

To inspect these files:

### In Finder

1. Navigate to your project folder
2. Press **Cmd+Shift+.** to show hidden files
3. Open the `.nativeline` folder
4. View files with any text editor

### In Terminal

```bash
cd ~/Documents/Nativeline\ Projects/YourApp
cat .nativeline/project.md
```

## Should You Edit These Files?

<Warning>
  **Generally, no.** These files are managed by Nativeline. Manual edits may:
  - Be overwritten by the AI
  - Cause inconsistencies
  - Corrupt JSON files if malformed
</Warning>

However, you **can** edit them if you understand the format. For example:
- Add notes to project.md
- Correct wrong information in memory.md

Just be careful and keep backups.

## File Locations Summary

| File | Purpose | Location |
|------|---------|----------|
| project.md | Persistent project knowledge | `.nativeline/project.md` |
| memory.md | Working memory | `.nativeline/memory.md` |
| chat_history.json | Conversation history | `.nativeline/chat_history.json` |
| active.md | Current plan | `.nativeline/plans/active.md` |
