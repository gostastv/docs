# Working with Plans

When you ask Nativeline to build something, the AI creates a plan and immediately starts executing it. Understanding plans helps you follow along and work more effectively.

## What is a Plan?

A plan serves three purposes:
1. **Internal guidance** — Helps the AI know what to do next
2. **Memory** — Helps the AI remember what it already did
3. **Transparency** — Shows you what's happening so you can follow along

The AI creates plans and executes them automatically — there's no approval step. You can watch the progress and intervene if needed, but most of the time you just let it work.

### Example

You say: "Add a profile screen with user avatar, name, and settings"

The AI creates a plan:
1. Create ProfileView.swift
2. Add avatar image component
3. Add name display
4. Add settings section with toggles
5. Connect to navigation
6. Test and refine

### Viewing the Plan

You can see the plan in the chat as a todo list:
- ⏳ Pending tasks
- 🔄 Current task (in progress)
- ✅ Completed tasks

---

## How Plans Work

### Automatic Planning

When you describe what you want, the AI:
1. Analyzes your request
2. Breaks it into logical steps
3. Shows the plan in the chat
4. Executes each step in order
5. Marks tasks complete as it goes

### Plan Persistence

Plans persist between sessions:
- Close Nativeline, reopen — the plan is still there
- Come back tomorrow — pick up where you left off
- The AI remembers the current state

---

## The /planclear Command

**`/planclear`** clears the current plan and lets you start fresh.

### When to Use /planclear

- You want to work on something different
- The current plan is stuck or going in the wrong direction
- You've changed your mind about what you want
- The AI keeps trying to complete a task you no longer need

### How to Use It

Just type in the chat:
```
/planclear
```

The AI will:
1. Clear the current plan
2. Confirm it's been cleared
3. Wait for your next request

### What /planclear Does NOT Do

- Does NOT undo any code changes
- Does NOT delete your files
- Does NOT reset your project

It only clears the plan — your code stays exactly as it is.

---

## Resuming Work

### Coming Back to a Plan

If you had a plan in progress and return later, you can:

**Option 1: Continue where you left off**
```
continue
```
or
```
keep going
```

**Option 2: Start fresh**
```
/planclear
```
Then describe what you want to do instead.

### What if the Plan is Stuck?

If the AI keeps trying and failing:

1. Try: "Let's try a different approach to [the stuck task]"
2. Or: `/planclear` and re-describe what you want
3. Or: Provide more specific guidance about what's going wrong

---

## Plan Best Practices

### 1. Let the AI Plan

You don't need to tell the AI exactly what files to create or what code to write. Just describe the feature and let it plan.

**Don't:**
```
Create a file called ProfileView.swift with a struct that has an @State variable for the username and use a VStack with a TextField...
```

**Do:**
```
Add a profile screen where users can edit their username and email
```

### 2. Watch the Plan Execute

The AI shows its plan as it works. You can:
- **Let it work:** Most of the time, just watch it execute
- **Redirect:** "Actually, don't include email, just username"
- **Clarify:** "That's not quite what I want, let me explain differently"

The AI doesn't wait for approval — it starts working immediately. But you can always interrupt if it's going in the wrong direction.

### 3. Keep Plans Focused

One clear request = one focused plan.

**Too broad:**
```
Build my whole app with user profiles, posts, comments, likes, messaging, and notifications
```

**Just right:**
```
Start with user profiles where people can set their name and avatar
```

After that works, add the next feature.

### 4. Don't Interrupt Mid-Plan (Usually)

Let the AI complete its current task before adding new requests. Interrupting can lead to half-finished work.

However, if you see it going wrong, it's fine to say:
```
Stop, that's not what I meant. Let me clarify...
```

## Working with Long Plans

For complex features, plans might have many steps.

### Tracking Progress

Watch the todo list to see:
- How many tasks remain
- What's currently being worked on
- What's already complete

### If Something Breaks Mid-Plan

If a build fails in the middle of a plan:
1. The AI will attempt to fix it
2. After fixing, it continues with the remaining tasks
3. You don't need to restart the whole plan

### Taking Breaks

You can close Nativeline at any point:
1. Progress is saved
2. When you return, you can continue or clear

---

## Common Scenarios

### "I want to change direction"

```
/planclear
```
Then describe your new direction.

### "I want to add to the current plan"

Wait for the current plan to complete, then:
```
Now also add [new feature]
```

### "The plan keeps failing on one step"

```
Let's skip that step for now and continue with the rest.
Come back to [problematic step] later.
```

Or:
```
/planclear
Let's take a simpler approach to [feature]
```

### "I don't understand what the plan is doing"

```
Explain what you're doing and why
```

The AI will describe its approach in plain English.

### "The plan is too complicated"

```
/planclear
Let's do a simpler version first: just [basic version]
```

Start simple, add complexity later.

---

## Plan Memory

The AI remembers:
- The current plan and its status
- What it's already tried
- Previous conversation context
- Your project's structure and patterns

This memory helps it:
- Avoid repeating failed approaches
- Build consistently with existing code
- Remember your preferences

### The .nativeline Folder

Your project contains a hidden `.nativeline` folder with:
- AI memory about your project
- Conversation history
- Current plan state

Don't delete this folder unless you want to reset the AI's memory.

## Troubleshooting Plans

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Plan won't clear" icon="broom">
    Make sure you type exactly: `/planclear`

    It should work immediately. If not, try closing and reopening the project.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="AI keeps working on old plan" icon="rotate">
    1. Type `/planclear` explicitly
    2. Wait for confirmation
    3. Then start your new request
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Plan is too ambitious" icon="mountain">
    Clear it and start smaller:
    ```
    /planclear
    Let's start with just [the core feature]. We'll add more later.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="AI forgot what it was doing" icon="brain">
    Try:
    ```
    What was the plan? Can you summarize where we are?
    ```

    Or start fresh if needed.
  </Accordion>
