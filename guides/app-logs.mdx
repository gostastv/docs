# Reading App Logs

**Pro plan or higher required**

Build errors show problems at compile time. But what about issues that happen while your app is running? That's where app logs come in.

## What Are App Logs?

Logs are messages your app produces while running. They show:
- What code is executing
- Values of variables
- Errors that occur at runtime
- User actions and their effects

## Accessing Logs in Nativeline

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Code Editor">
    Click the **Code Editor** tab in the Nativeline interface.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Switch to Logs View">
    Find and click the **Logs** tab or section within the Code Editor.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Your App">
    Build and run your app. Logs appear in real-time.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Watch the Output">
    As you interact with your app, logs show what's happening.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Log Output

### Basic Log Structure

```
2024-01-15 10:30:45.123 MyApp[12345:67890] Save button tapped
2024-01-15 10:30:45.456 MyApp[12345:67890] Saving data: User(name: "John")
2024-01-15 10:30:45.789 MyApp[12345:67890] Save completed successfully
```

Each line shows:
- **Timestamp:** When it happened
- **App name:** Which app
- **Message:** The actual log content

### Log Types

| Type | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Info logs** | Normal operation, status updates |
| **Warning logs** | Something unusual, but not critical |
| **Error logs** | Something went wrong |
| **Debug logs** | Developer debugging info |

---

## Adding Logs to Your App

Ask the AI to add logging:

### For Debugging a Specific Feature

```
Add print statements to the saveData function to show:
- When the function starts
- What data is being saved
- Whether the save succeeded or failed
```

### For Tracking User Actions

```
Add logging for all button taps so I can see what users are doing
```

### For API/Network Issues

```
Add logging to show:
- When API requests start
- What data is being sent
- What response comes back
- Any errors that occur
```

---

## Common Debugging Scenarios

### Debugging "Nothing Happens" Issues

Your button doesn't seem to work? Add logs:

```
Add a print statement at the start of the button's action
to confirm it's being triggered
```

If the log appears: The button works, the issue is in the code after.
If no log appears: The button isn't connected properly.

### Debugging Data Issues

Data not showing up?

```
Add logging to show:
- When data is loaded
- How many items were loaded
- The actual content of the first item
```

Check the logs to see if data exists and what it contains.

### Debugging Navigation Issues

Screen not appearing?

```
Add logging when the navigation to [screen] is triggered
and when [screen] appears
```

Follow the trail to see where it breaks.

### Debugging Crash-Like Behavior

App freezing or behaving strangely?

```
Add extensive logging throughout [feature] to trace exactly
where the problem occurs
```

The last log before the freeze indicates where to look.

## Reading Swift Error Messages

When Swift errors appear in logs, they often include useful info:

### Optional Unwrapping Errors

```
Fatal error: Unexpectedly found nil while unwrapping an Optional value
```

**Meaning:** Your code tried to use a nil value that should have had a value.

**Fix:** Ask the AI to add nil checking for the relevant variable.

### Array Index Errors

```
Fatal error: Index out of range
```

**Meaning:** Accessing an array position that doesn't exist.

**Fix:** Check array bounds before accessing, or verify the data exists.

### Type Casting Errors

```
Could not cast value of type 'X' to 'Y'
```

**Meaning:** Tried to convert between incompatible types.

**Fix:** Check the actual type and handle it appropriately.

## Effective Logging Strategies

### 1. Log Entry and Exit

```swift
print("▶️ saveProfile started")
// ... code ...
print("✅ saveProfile completed")
```

This shows whether functions complete or exit early.

### 2. Log Important Values

```swift
print("📊 User data: \(userData)")
print("📊 Items count: \(items.count)")
```

See what your variables actually contain.

### 3. Log Decision Points

```swift
if isLoggedIn {
    print("🔓 User is logged in, showing profile")
} else {
    print("🔒 User not logged in, showing login")
}
```

Understand which code paths execute.

### 4. Use Distinctive Markers

Using emojis or prefixes makes logs easier to scan:
- `▶️` Start of function
- `✅` Success
- `❌` Error
- `⚠️` Warning
- `📊` Data values
- `🔄` State changes

---

## Filtering and Searching Logs

When there's a lot of output:

### Search for Specific Text

Look for your custom log messages or error keywords.

### Filter by Feature

If you're debugging the save feature, search for "save" in logs.

### Filter by Error Level

Look for "error", "failed", "nil", or "crash" to find problems.

## When to Use Logs vs Build Errors

| Situation | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| App won't compile | Build errors in chat |
| App compiles but crashes | Runtime logs |
| App runs but feature doesn't work | Runtime logs |
| UI looks wrong | Visual inspection + logs |
| Data doesn't save | Logs showing save operations |
| API not working | Logs showing requests/responses |

---

## Removing Debug Logs

Before publishing your app, clean up debug logs:

```
Remove all the debug print statements we added for troubleshooting.
Keep only important error logging.
```

Or for more control:

```
Replace debug print statements with proper logging that only
shows in debug builds, not in production.
```

---

## Advanced: Console.app

For even more detailed debugging, you can use macOS's Console app:

1. Open **Console.app** (in Applications → Utilities)
2. Select your Simulator in the sidebar
3. Run your app
4. See comprehensive system logs

This shows logs from iOS itself, not just your app.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Logs aren't appearing" icon="terminal">
    - Make sure your app is running
    - Check you're on the Logs tab
    - Try adding explicit print statements
    - Restart the Simulator
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Too many logs to read" icon="list">
    - Add distinctive prefixes to your logs
    - Search for specific terms
    - Ask the AI to reduce logging: "Only log errors, not normal operations"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Don't have logs tab" icon="eye-slash">
    The Logs feature requires Pro plan or higher. Check your subscription in Settings.
