# Prompt Writing Workshop

The quality of your prompts directly determines the quality of your apps. This guide teaches you how to communicate effectively with Nativeline's AI.

## The Anatomy of a Good Prompt

Every effective prompt has three elements:

### 1. What (The Action)
What do you want to happen?
- "Add a button"
- "Create a new screen"
- "Fix the layout"

### 2. Where (The Location)
Where should it happen?
- "on the home screen"
- "below the title"
- "in the settings tab"

### 3. How (The Details)
What should it look like or do?
- "with a blue background and white text"
- "that saves the user's preferences"
- "with 16pt padding"

## Good vs. Bad Prompts

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="❌ Too Vague" icon="cloud">
    "Make the app look better"

    **Problem:** The AI has to guess what "better" means to you. It might change colors you liked or add effects you don't want.
  </Card>

  <Card title="✅ Specific" icon="bullseye">
    "Add 16pt padding to all cards, use 12pt rounded corners, and add a subtle shadow"

    **Why it works:** Exact values, clear scope, predictable result.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="❌ Overwhelming" icon="bomb">
    "Build me a complete social media app with posts, comments, likes, follows, profiles, messaging, notifications, and a discover feed"

    **Problem:** Too many features at once leads to errors and confusion.
  </Card>

  <Card title="✅ Incremental" icon="stairs">
    "Start with a feed of posts. Each post has a title, body, and author name. Users can scroll through posts."

    **Why it works:** One focused feature. You can add comments, likes, etc. later.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## The WHAT-WHERE-HOW Framework

Use this framework for consistent results:

### Example 1: Adding a Button

```
Add a submit button [WHAT]
at the bottom of the form [WHERE]
that's full-width with a green background, white text, and 12pt rounded corners [HOW]
```

### Example 2: Creating a Screen

```
Create a settings screen [WHAT]
accessible from the profile tab [WHERE]
with toggle switches for notifications, dark mode, and sounds [HOW]
```

### Example 3: Fixing an Issue

```
Fix the text overlap [WHAT]
on the task list items [WHERE]
by adding proper spacing and truncating long titles with ellipsis [HOW]
```

## Describing User Experiences

Some of the best prompts describe what users should experience:

### Instead of technical specs...

❌ "Create a UIButton with a closure that increments a @State variable"

### Describe the user experience...

✅ "Add a button that counts taps. Show the count above the button. Each tap should feel responsive with a quick animation."

The AI knows the technical implementation — your job is to describe the experience.

---

## Using Reference Images

Images are incredibly powerful. You can:

### Share Screenshots
Paste a screenshot of an app you like:
> "Make my list look like this screenshot — same spacing and style"

### Share Mockups
Sketch something in Figma or on paper:
> "Here's my design mockup. Implement this exactly"

### Share Examples
Find a UI element you want:
> "Add a card that looks like this example"

<Tip>
  A picture is worth a thousand tokens. Images dramatically reduce back-and-forth and bit usage.
</Tip>

## Prompt Templates

### Adding a Feature

```
Add [feature name] that lets users [user action].
Show it [where in the app].
When users [interact], it should [result].
Style it with [visual details].
```

**Example:**
```
Add a favorites feature that lets users mark items as favorites.
Show a heart icon on each item card.
When users tap the heart, it should fill in and save the favorite.
Style it with a red filled heart for favorites, gray outline for non-favorites.
```

### Fixing a Bug

```
There's a problem with [what's broken].
What I expect: [expected behavior]
What happens instead: [actual behavior]
This occurs when [steps to reproduce].
```

**Example:**
```
There's a problem with the save button.
What I expect: Tapping save should store my data and show a confirmation.
What happens instead: Nothing happens when I tap it.
This occurs when I fill out the form and tap the save button.
```

### Changing Design

```
Update the [element] to have:
- [property 1]: [value]
- [property 2]: [value]
- [property 3]: [value]
Keep everything else the same.
```

**Example:**
```
Update the header to have:
- Background: dark blue (#1a365d)
- Title font: 24pt, bold, white
- Padding: 20pt top and bottom
Keep everything else the same.
```

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Being Too Technical

❌ "Implement a @StateObject with a published array using MVVM architecture"

✅ "Create a list that updates in real-time when items are added"

**Why:** The AI handles architecture. Describe the behavior you want.

### 2. Asking for Everything at Once

❌ "Build a fitness app with workouts, meal plans, progress tracking, social features, Apple Watch integration, and gamification"

✅ Start with: "Build a workout tracker where I can log exercises with name, sets, and reps"

**Why:** Build incrementally. Add features one at a time.

### 3. Not Providing Context

❌ "Add a button"

✅ "Add a 'Save Changes' button below the form that saves the edited profile information"

**Why:** Context helps the AI place and style things appropriately.

### 4. Ignoring Errors

When builds fail, don't just say "fix it."

✅ "The build is failing because the variable 'userName' isn't found. I think it should come from the login screen."

**Why:** Your context helps the AI fix issues faster.

## Iterating Effectively

You won't get perfection on the first try. Here's how to iterate:

### Start Broad, Then Refine

1. **First prompt:** "Add a profile section with user avatar and name"
2. **Refinement:** "Make the avatar larger, about 80pt"
3. **Refinement:** "Add a border around the avatar"
4. **Refinement:** "Center everything horizontally"

### Give Specific Feedback

Instead of: "That's not right"

Say: "The button is too small. Make it taller (50pt) and full-width"

### Reference What Works

"Keep the header exactly as it is, but change the body font to be larger"

---

## Efficiency Tips

### Save Bits with Better Prompts

| Expensive | Efficient |
|-----------|-----------|
| Multiple vague iterations | One specific request |
| "Make it better" | "Add these exact changes" |
| Building huge features at once | Building incrementally |
| Not using images | Providing reference images |

### The 30-Second Rule

Before sending a prompt, take 30 seconds to:
1. Add specific values (colors, sizes, spacing)
2. Clarify where the change should happen
3. Describe the expected outcome

This small investment saves significant bits.

## Practice Exercise

Try rewriting these vague prompts:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="'Make the login screen'" icon="question">
    **Better version:**
    "Create a login screen with:
    - Email and password text fields
    - A 'Log In' button below the fields
    - A 'Forgot Password?' link below the button
    - App logo centered at the top
    - Clean white background"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="'Add some settings'" icon="question">
    **Better version:**
    "Create a settings screen with toggles for:
    - Push notifications (default on)
    - Dark mode (default off)
    - Sound effects (default on)
    Group them with a 'Preferences' header. Add a 'Log Out' button at the bottom."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="'The app is broken'" icon="question">
    **Better version:**
    "The save button doesn't work. When I tap it after filling out the form, nothing happens. I expect it to save my data and show a confirmation. This started after adding the new profile picture feature."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
