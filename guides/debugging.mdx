# Debugging Guide

Things will go wrong. Builds will fail. Features won't work as expected. This guide teaches you everything about debugging in Nativeline.

## Understanding Build Errors

When you see "Build Failed" in Nativeline, it means the Swift code couldn't compile. This is normal and happens to everyone.

### What You'll See

When a build fails:
1. The chat shows an error message
2. The error includes the file and line number
3. The AI automatically analyzes the error
4. A fix is proposed

### Common Error Types

| Error Type | What It Means |
|------------|---------------|
| **Syntax Error** | Typo or malformed code |
| **Type Mismatch** | Wrong data type used |
| **Missing Reference** | Something isn't found |
| **Ambiguous Expression** | Code is unclear |
| **Missing Import** | Framework not imported |

---

## The Automatic Fix Cycle

Nativeline automatically attempts to fix build errors. Here's how it works:

### The 3-Attempt Process

```
Build Fails
    ↓
Attempt 1: AI analyzes error, proposes fix
    ↓
Build Fails Again?
    ↓
Attempt 2: AI tries different approach
    ↓
Build Fails Again?
    ↓
Attempt 3: AI tries another approach
    ↓
Still Failing?
    ↓
Manual intervention needed (see below)
```

Most errors are fixed within 1-2 attempts. Complex issues may require all 3.

### Watching the Process

You can see what's happening:
- The chat shows each attempt
- The todo list shows current status
- Tool cards show files being edited
- Build status shows success or failure

---

## When Automatic Fixes Fail

If the AI can't fix the error after 3 attempts, you need to intervene.

### The Manual Fix Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Press Run App">
    Click the **Run App** button in the interface.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for Popup">
    A popup appears asking what you want to do.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Apply Fix">
    Select **Apply Fix** to trigger another fix attempt with additional context.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide Context (Optional)">
    You can add context about what you think is wrong to help the AI.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### When to Provide Context

Help the AI by explaining:
- What you were trying to build
- What worked before this error
- What you think might be wrong
- Any patterns you've noticed

**Example:**
> "I was adding a save button. The error mentions 'user' not found — I think the variable should be 'currentUser' from the login screen."

## Describing Problems Effectively

How you describe issues dramatically affects fix success.

### Bad Descriptions

- ❌ "It's broken"
- ❌ "Fix it"
- ❌ "The build failed"

### Good Descriptions

- ✅ "The build fails with 'Cannot find User in scope' — I think it should use the UserProfile model instead"
- ✅ "This error started after I added the camera feature. The issue seems to be in PhotoView.swift"
- ✅ "The error says 'Type mismatch' — it's expecting a String but I'm passing an Int from the form"

### The Bug Report Framework

```
What I was trying to do:
[Brief description of the feature or change]

What I expected to happen:
[The expected behavior]

What actually happened:
[The error or unexpected behavior]

When this started:
[After which change or action]

What I think might be wrong:
[Your hypothesis, if any]
```

## Using the Code Editor for Debugging

**Pro plan or higher required**

The Code Editor provides powerful debugging tools.

### Viewing Build Errors

1. Open the **Code Editor** tab
2. Files with errors are highlighted
3. Click to see the exact line with the problem
4. The error message appears inline

### Reading Runtime Logs

When your app runs (even successfully), logs show what's happening:

1. Open Code Editor → **Logs** tab
2. Run your app
3. Watch real-time output
4. Look for `print()` statements or errors

### Adding Debug Prints

Ask the AI: "Add print statements to the saveData function so I can see what's happening"

Or manually add them (Pro plan):
```swift
print("Save button tapped")
print("Saving data: \(userData)")
print("Save completed: \(success)")
```

## Common Errors and Solutions

### "Cannot find 'X' in scope"

**What it means:** A variable, function, or type isn't found.

**Solutions:**
- Check for typos in the name
- Make sure the variable is defined in this file
- Check if an import is missing
- Ask: "Where should [X] come from? I see it's not found."

### "Type 'X' has no member 'Y'"

**What it means:** You're trying to access something that doesn't exist on that type.

**Solutions:**
- Check the property name
- Verify the type is correct
- Ask: "What properties does [X] have? I'm trying to access [Y]."

### "Cannot convert value of type 'X' to expected type 'Y'"

**What it means:** Type mismatch — you're using the wrong type.

**Solutions:**
- Check if you need to convert the value
- Verify the function signature
- Ask: "Convert [variable] from [X] to [Y]"

### "Missing argument for parameter"

**What it means:** A function call is missing required parameters.

**Solutions:**
- Check the function definition
- Add the missing parameter
- Ask: "What parameters does [function] need?"

### "Value of optional type 'X?' must be unwrapped"

**What it means:** You're using an optional value without handling the nil case.

**Solutions:**
- Ask: "Safely unwrap [variable] with a default value"
- Or: "Add nil checking before using [variable]"

## Debugging Runtime Issues

Not all issues are build errors. Sometimes the app builds but doesn't work correctly.

### App Crashes After Launch

**Check:**
- Are all required permissions granted?
- Is network data loading correctly?
- Are you accessing something that's nil?

**Ask:** "The app crashes when I [action]. Add error handling and debug logs."

### Feature Doesn't Work

**Check:**
- Is the button connected to the right action?
- Is data being saved/loaded correctly?
- Are state changes triggering UI updates?

**Ask:** "The [feature] isn't working. Add debug output to trace what's happening."

### Data Not Saving

**Check:**
- Is the save function being called?
- Are there any silent errors?
- Is local storage set up correctly?

**Ask:** "Add logging to the save process so I can see if data is being saved correctly."

## Prevention: Building Without Errors

Reduce debugging by building better:

### 1. Build Incrementally

Don't ask for everything at once. Add features one at a time, testing each.

### 2. Be Specific

Vague requests lead to unexpected implementations. Specific requests reduce errors.

### 3. Test Early and Often

Don't wait until you have 10 features to test. Check after each change.

### 4. Start Simple

Get the basic version working first, then enhance it.

### 5. Use Reference Images

When the AI can see what you want, it makes fewer mistakes.

## When to Start Fresh

Sometimes it's faster to start over than to fix:

### Signs You Should Start Fresh

- The same error keeps returning
- The AI is stuck in a loop
- The code structure is fundamentally wrong
- Multiple features are broken simultaneously

### How to Start Fresh (Partially)

"Delete the [feature] code and rebuild it from scratch"

This removes the problematic code while keeping the rest of your app intact.

### How to Start Fresh (Clean Slate)

For the whole project:
1. Create a new project
2. Copy your working ideas over
3. Build more carefully this time

This is rare but sometimes the fastest path.
