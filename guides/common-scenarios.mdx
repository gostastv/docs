## UI & Layout Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Text is getting cut off" icon="text-slash">
    **The problem:** Long text doesn't fit and gets truncated.

    **Solutions:**

    For truncation with ellipsis:
    ```
    Truncate long text with "..." and show full text when tapped
    ```

    For wrapping:
    ```
    Let long text wrap to multiple lines instead of truncating
    ```

    For scrolling:
    ```
    Make the text area scrollable for long content
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Items overlap or are misaligned" icon="objects-column">
    **The problem:** UI elements are positioned incorrectly.

    **Solutions:**

    Be specific about spacing:
    ```
    Add 16pt spacing between all elements in the form.
    Ensure nothing overlaps.
    ```

    Use proper layout:
    ```
    Align all form labels to the left edge and all
    input fields to have matching leading edges.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Content goes under the notch or home indicator" icon="mobile">
    **The problem:** Content appears in unsafe areas of the screen.

    **Solution:**
    ```
    Respect safe areas on all screens. Content should not
    appear under the notch, dynamic island, or home indicator.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keyboard covers input fields" icon="keyboard">
    **The problem:** Can't see what you're typing because the keyboard is in the way.

    **Solution:**
    ```
    When the keyboard appears, scroll or adjust the view so
    the active text field is visible above the keyboard.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="List items look crowded" icon="list">
    **The problem:** Items in a list are too close together.

    **Solution:**
    ```
    Add 12pt vertical padding inside each list item.
    Add 8pt spacing between list items.
    Use a subtle separator or slight background difference between items.
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Data & Storage Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Data disappears when app closes" icon="database">
    **The problem:** Nothing is saved between sessions.

    **Solution:**
    ```
    Save [data type] using SwiftData so it persists when
    the app is closed and reopened.
    ```

    For simple settings:
    ```
    Save user preferences using UserDefaults.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't delete items" icon="trash">
    **The problem:** No way to remove data.

    **Solutions:**

    Swipe to delete:
    ```
    Add swipe-to-delete gesture on list items.
    Show confirmation before deleting.
    ```

    Delete button:
    ```
    Add a trash button to each item that deletes it after confirmation.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Data loads slowly" icon="spinner">
    **The problem:** App feels sluggish loading data.

    **Solutions:**

    Add loading state:
    ```
    Show a loading spinner while data is being fetched.
    ```

    Load progressively:
    ```
    Load the first 20 items immediately, then load more as the user scrolls.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Search doesn't work well" icon="magnifying-glass">
    **The problem:** Search results aren't helpful.

    **Solution:**
    ```
    Search should filter by [title/name] and [description/content].
    Search as the user types (debounced).
    Show "No results for [query]" when nothing matches.
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Navigation Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can't go back to previous screen" icon="arrow-left">
    **The problem:** No back button or back gesture.

    **Solution:**
    ```
    Add a back button in the top-left that returns to the previous screen.
    Also enable the swipe-from-edge gesture to go back.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tab bar doesn't show on all screens" icon="bars-staggered">
    **The problem:** Tab bar disappears on certain screens.

    **Solution:**
    ```
    Keep the tab bar visible on all main screens.
    Only hide it for modal presentations and detail views.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Modal/sheet won't dismiss" icon="xmark">
    **The problem:** Can't close a popup or sheet.

    **Solution:**
    ```
    Add a close button (X) in the top-right corner of the modal.
    Also allow swiping down to dismiss.
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Performance Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="App is slow or laggy" icon="gauge-simple">
    **The problem:** UI isn't responsive.

    **Solutions:**

    For list performance:
    ```
    Use lazy loading for the list. Only render items
    that are visible on screen.
    ```

    For image performance:
    ```
    Resize and cache images. Don't load full-resolution
    images for thumbnails.
    ```

    General:
    ```
    Move heavy work off the main thread.
    Show loading indicators for async operations.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="First build takes forever" icon="clock">
    **The problem:** Initial build is very slow.

    **This is normal.** First builds take 30-60 seconds because Xcode compiles everything. Subsequent builds are much faster (5-15 seconds).

    If it's consistently slow:
    - Close other applications
    - Ensure sufficient disk space (10GB+)
    - Restart your Mac
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Simulator is slow" icon="mobile-screen">
    **The problem:** App runs slowly in Simulator.

    **Solutions:**
    - Use a simpler device (iPhone SE vs iPhone 15 Pro Max)
    - Close other Simulators
    - The Simulator is always slower than real devices — test on TestFlight for true performance
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Supabase/Cloud Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can't connect to Supabase" icon="plug">
    **The problem:** Connection fails.

    **Checklist:**
    1. Verify project URL (ends in `.supabase.co`)
    2. Use the `anon` key, not `service_role`
    3. Check if project is initialized (takes ~2 min after creation)
    4. Ensure internet connection

    **Tell the AI:**
    ```
    I'm getting connection errors to Supabase.
    My URL is [url] and I'm using the anon key.
    Can you verify the connection setup?
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Data not saving to cloud" icon="cloud-arrow-up">
    **The problem:** Local changes don't sync.

    **Check:**
    1. RLS policies allow inserts
    2. User is authenticated (if required)
    3. Required fields have values

    **Tell the AI:**
    ```
    Data isn't saving to Supabase. I've checked RLS policies
    and the user is authenticated. Can you add error logging
    to see what's happening?
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Authentication not working" icon="user-lock">
    **The problem:** Sign up or login fails.

    **Check in Supabase:**
    1. Authentication → Users: is the user created?
    2. Authentication → Settings: is email confirmation enabled?
    3. For testing, you can disable email confirmation

    **Tell the AI:**
    ```
    Authentication is failing. The error is [error].
    Show me what's happening and add proper error messages.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Real-time updates not working" icon="bolt">
    **The problem:** Changes don't sync between devices.

    **Check:**
    1. Real-time is enabled in Supabase (default: on)
    2. Subscriptions are set up correctly
    3. RLS policies allow selects

    **Tell the AI:**
    ```
    Real-time updates aren't working. When I change data
    in Supabase dashboard, the app doesn't update.
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## API Integration Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="API returns error" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **The problem:** External API calls fail.

    **Tell the AI:**
    ```
    The API call is failing. Add logging to show:
    - The request URL and parameters
    - The response status code
    - The error message
    ```

    Common causes:
    - Invalid API key
    - Wrong endpoint URL
    - Missing required parameters
    - Rate limiting
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Data format is wrong" icon="file-code">
    **The problem:** API returns data but it doesn't display correctly.

    **Tell the AI:**
    ```
    Log the raw API response so I can see the data structure.
    The data isn't displaying correctly.
    ```

    Then:
    ```
    The API returns data like this: [structure].
    Update the model to match this format.
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Media & Files

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Camera not working" icon="camera">
    **Note:** Camera doesn't work in Simulator. You must test on a real device via TestFlight.

    **If permission issues:**
    ```
    Make sure camera permission is requested with a
    clear usage description.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Images not loading" icon="image">
    **The problem:** Images don't display.

    **For local images:**
    ```
    Check that images are in the asset catalog and
    using the correct names.
    ```

    **For remote images:**
    ```
    Use AsyncImage for loading remote images.
    Show a placeholder while loading.
    Handle the error case if the image fails to load.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Large images causing issues" icon="file-image">
    **The problem:** App slows down or crashes with large images.

    **Solution:**
    ```
    Resize images to appropriate display size before storing.
    Use thumbnails for lists and grids.
    Load full-resolution only when viewing full screen.
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## App Behavior

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="App crashes on launch" icon="bomb">
    **Possible causes:**
    1. Missing required data
    2. Force unwrapping a nil value
    3. Permissions not configured

    **Tell the AI:**
    ```
    The app crashes immediately on launch.
    Add a try-catch around initialization code
    and log any errors that occur.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Nothing happens when I tap a button" icon="hand-pointer">
    **Possible causes:**
    1. Button action not connected
    2. Action throws an error silently
    3. UI is blocking the button

    **Tell the AI:**
    ```
    The [button] doesn't do anything when tapped.
    Add a print statement to confirm the tap registers,
    then check what happens in the action.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="State doesn't update the UI" icon="refresh">
    **The problem:** Data changes but UI stays the same.

    **Tell the AI:**
    ```
    When [data] changes, the UI doesn't update.
    Make sure the state is properly observed and
    the view refreshes when it changes.
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
