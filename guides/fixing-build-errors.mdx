# Fixing Build Errors

Nativeline's AI automatically fixes most build errors. But sometimes you need to step in. This guide covers manual intervention when automatic fixes fail.

## When Manual Intervention is Needed

You'll need to intervene when:
- The AI has tried 3 times and still failing
- The same error keeps recurring
- The AI is stuck in a loop
- You understand the problem better than the AI

---

## The Manual Fix Process

### Step-by-Step

<Steps>
  <Step title="Recognize the Pattern">
    If you see the AI attempting fixes repeatedly without success, it's time to intervene.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Press Run App">
    Click the **Run App** button in the Nativeline interface.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for the Popup">
    A dialog appears asking what you want to do.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Apply Fix">
    Select **Apply Fix** to trigger another attempt with a fresh perspective.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide Additional Context">
    If prompted, explain what you think is wrong. This helps the AI approach the problem differently.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What Happens Next

The AI will:
1. Re-analyze the error with fresh context
2. Consider approaches it hasn't tried
3. Use your hints if provided
4. Attempt a new fix

## Providing Helpful Context

The more specific you are, the better the fix.

### Unhelpful Context

- "It's broken"
- "Fix it"
- "I don't know what's wrong"

### Helpful Context

```
The error says 'user' isn't found. I think it should be
'currentUser' from the AuthManager I created earlier.
```

```
This started happening after I added the camera feature.
The issue might be related to the new permission code.
```

```
The error mentions a type mismatch. The function expects
a String but I'm passing an Int from the slider value.
```

---

## Understanding Common Errors

### "Cannot find 'X' in scope"

**What it means:** A variable, function, or type isn't found.

**How to help:**
```
I think 'X' should be [correct name] from [file/location].
```
or
```
I created 'X' in [file]. Maybe it needs to be imported or made public.
```

### "Type 'X' has no member 'Y'"

**What it means:** Accessing a property or method that doesn't exist.

**How to help:**
```
The property might be named differently. Check [struct/class name]
to see what properties it actually has.
```

### "Cannot convert value of type..."

**What it means:** Type mismatch.

**How to help:**
```
It needs a [correct type]. Convert the value or use a different property.
```

### "Missing argument for parameter"

**What it means:** Function call is incomplete.

**How to help:**
```
The function needs [parameter name]. It should be [value/source].
```

### "Value of optional type must be unwrapped"

**What it means:** Using a possibly-nil value unsafely.

**How to help:**
```
Safely unwrap it with a default value or guard statement.
```

## When the Same Error Keeps Returning

If the same error persists despite multiple fixes:

### 1. Try a Different Approach

```
This approach isn't working. Try implementing [feature]
using [alternative method] instead.
```

### 2. Simplify

```
/planclear
Let's try a simpler version without [complex part].
```

### 3. Remove and Rebuild

```
Remove the code for [feature] completely and rebuild it from scratch.
```

### 4. Work Around It

```
Skip this feature for now. Let's continue with the rest and
come back to this later.
```

---

## Using the Code Editor (Pro)

With a Pro plan, you can investigate and fix errors yourself:

### Finding the Error

1. Open **Code Editor** tab
2. Files with errors are highlighted
3. Click to see the exact line
4. Error message appears inline

### Making Manual Fixes

If you spot an obvious fix:
1. Edit the code directly
2. Save (Cmd+S)
3. The app rebuilds automatically

### When to Edit Manually

Manual edits work well for:
- Obvious typos
- Simple variable name changes
- Quick value adjustments
- Adding missing imports

Leave complex fixes to the AI.

## Breaking the Error Loop

Sometimes the AI gets stuck trying the same thing repeatedly.

### Signs of a Loop

- Same error message over and over
- AI making the same changes
- Undoing its own fixes
- No progress after multiple attempts

### Breaking Out

**Option 1: Explicit Different Approach**
```
Stop trying that approach. Instead, try [specific alternative].
```

**Option 2: Clear and Restart**
```
/planclear
Let's start over with [feature]. Use a simpler approach this time.
```

**Option 3: Manual Intervention**
If you have Pro plan, make the fix yourself in the code editor.

**Option 4: Temporary Skip**
```
Let's leave this for now and work on [other feature].
We'll come back to this later.
```

## Preventing Future Errors

### Build Incrementally

Don't request huge features all at once:

❌ "Build a complete e-commerce system"

✅ "Add a product list page" → "Add product details" → "Add cart" → etc.

### Be Specific

Vague requests lead to implementation mistakes:

❌ "Make it work"

✅ "Connect the save button to store the form data in SwiftData"

### Test Frequently

Check after each change. Catching errors early is easier than debugging cascading failures.

### Use Reference Images

Visual references reduce misunderstandings and implementation errors.

---

## When to Start Fresh

Sometimes starting over is faster than fixing:

### Signs It's Time to Rebuild

- Multiple interconnected errors
- Fundamental design flaw
- More time debugging than building
- The code structure is wrong

### Partial Rebuild

```
Delete all the [feature] code and rebuild it from scratch.
Keep everything else.
```

### Full Restart (Rare)

If the whole project is broken:
1. Create a new project
2. Describe your working features
3. Rebuild more carefully

This is rare but sometimes the fastest path.
