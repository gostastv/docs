# How Do I...

Your quick reference for common actions. Find what you need, get the answer, and keep building.

---

## Plans & Tasks

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I clear a plan?" icon="broom">
    Type `/planclear` in the chat.

    This clears the current plan and lets you start fresh. Your code remains unchanged — only the plan is cleared.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I resume a plan?" icon="play">
    Just say "continue" or "keep going" in the chat.

    The AI remembers where it left off and picks up from there.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I start completely fresh?" icon="refresh">
    1. Type `/planclear` to clear the current plan
    2. Then describe what you want to do next

    Your code stays intact, but the AI approaches your new request without being influenced by the old plan.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I see what the AI is doing?" icon="eye">
    Watch the code previews and tool cards in the chat interface.

    The AI shows files being created and edited in real-time. You can also use `/plan` to check the current plan status.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I stop the AI mid-task?" icon="stop">
    Click the **Stop** button in the chat interface, or press **Escape**.

    The AI will stop after completing its current action. Any code written will remain.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I give feedback on what the AI built?" icon="comment">
    Just tell it what's wrong or what you'd like changed:

    - "That's not quite right, I wanted..."
    - "Change the color to blue instead"
    - "Make it bigger"
    - "Undo that and try a different approach"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Debugging & Errors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens after the AI fails 3 times?" icon="rotate-right">
    After 3 automatic fix attempts:

    1. A **Continue Fixing** card appears in the chat
    2. Optionally add more context in your message
    3. Click **Continue Fixing**

    The AI will automatically analyze the error and attempt a new fix with a fresh approach.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I see the actual error?" icon="code">
    Look in the chat — the build error is displayed there. It shows the error message and usually the file/line where it occurred.

    On Pro plans, you can also see detailed logs in the Code Editor.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I read app logs?" icon="terminal">
    **Pro plan required**

    1. Open the **Code Editor** tab
    2. Switch to the **Logs** view
    3. Run your app
    4. Logs appear in real-time

    Great for debugging runtime issues, not just build errors.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I fix a stuck build?" icon="circle-xmark">
    Try these in order:

    1. Describe the issue in your own words to the AI
    2. Type `/planclear` and re-explain what you want
    3. Close and reopen the project
    4. As last resort: delete the problematic code and ask the AI to rebuild it
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I undo what the AI did?" icon="rotate-left">
    Say: "Undo that last change" or "Revert what you just did"

    The AI can undo its recent work. For older changes, you may need to manually revert or ask it to "remove the [feature] you added earlier."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I make the AI try a different approach?" icon="shuffle">
    Say: "Try a different approach" or "That didn't work, try another way"

    Be specific if you can: "Try using a List instead of a ScrollView" or "Try a simpler implementation"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Building & Testing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I run my app?" icon="play">
    Your app runs automatically after each successful build. You'll see it in the iOS Simulator on the right side of the screen.

    To manually trigger: press the **Run App** button or use the keyboard shortcut.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I test on different iPhone sizes?" icon="mobile">
    In the Simulator:
    1. Go to **Window → Device** (or use the Hardware menu)
    2. Select a different device (iPhone SE, iPhone 15 Pro Max, etc.)

    Or in Nativeline, you may have device selection options.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I reset the Simulator?" icon="trash">
    In the Simulator menu:
    **Device → Erase All Content and Settings**

    This resets the Simulator to factory state, clearing all app data and permissions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I enter test data?" icon="keyboard">
    Just type directly in the Simulator. Click text fields and type.

    For testing quickly: "Add some sample data so I can test how the list looks with multiple items"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why is the first build slow?" icon="clock">
    First build compiles the entire Xcode project from scratch. This takes 30-60 seconds.

    Subsequent builds are incremental and much faster (5-15 seconds).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Settings & Configuration

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I change my app's name?" icon="signature">
    Go to **Settings → App Identity** (or Project Settings).

    - Name under the app icon
    - Name in the Simulator
    - Name on the App Store (if published)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I change the app icon?" icon="image">
    Go to **Settings → App Identity** and upload a new icon image.

  <Accordion title="How do I add a permission?" icon="lock">
    Go to **Settings → Permissions**.

    Enable the permissions you need (Camera, Location, Photo Library, etc.). Nativeline automatically adds the required usage descriptions.

    Or ask the AI: "Add camera permission to the app"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I enable a capability?" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Go to **Settings → Capabilities**.

    Enable features like Push Notifications, Sign in with Apple, HealthKit, etc.

    Some capabilities require an Apple Developer account.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I switch to dark mode?" icon="moon">
    Go to **Settings → Appearance**.

    You can set light, dark, or system-follows modes.

    Or ask the AI: "Make the app support dark mode with appropriate colors"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Data & Storage

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I add cloud storage?" icon="cloud">
    Connect Supabase in your project settings:

    1. Create a Supabase account at supabase.com
    2. Get your project URL and anon key
    3. Tell the AI: "Connect to Supabase with URL: [your-url] and key: [your-key]"

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I save data locally?" icon="database">
    Ask the AI: "Save [data] locally using SwiftData so it persists when the app is closed"

    SwiftData is Apple's modern local storage solution.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I delete all app data?" icon="trash">
    In the Simulator:
    1. **Device → Erase All Content and Settings** (full reset)
    2. Or delete just your app: long press → Delete App

    This clears all local storage for your app.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where are my projects saved?" icon="folder">
    Projects are stored locally at:
    ```
    ~/Documents/Nativeline Projects/
    ```

    Each project has its own folder with the project name.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Code & Editing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I see the code?" icon="code">
    **Pro plan or higher required**

    Click the **Code Editor** tab to view all Swift code. You can browse files, read code, and make edits.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I edit the code myself?" icon="pencil">
