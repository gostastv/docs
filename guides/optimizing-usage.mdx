# Optimizing AI Usage

Bits measure your AI usage in Nativeline. Using them wisely means building more with less. This guide shares strategies for efficient building.

## Understanding Bit Consumption

Not all requests use the same number of bits.

### What Uses More Bits

- Vague requests that need multiple iterations
- Complex features built all at once
- Repeated error-fix cycles
- Large code rewrites
- Back-and-forth clarifications

### What Uses Fewer Bits

- Specific, clear requests
- Features built incrementally
- First-time success (fewer fix attempts)
- Small, focused changes
- Using reference images

---

## The Specificity Principle

**The more specific your request, the fewer bits it uses.**

### Expensive (Vague)

```
Make the app look better
```
→ AI guesses, you correct, repeat several times
→ **60+ bits**

### Efficient (Specific)

```
Add 16pt padding to all cards, 12pt rounded corners,
and a subtle drop shadow (offset 0, blur 8, opacity 10%)
```
→ AI implements exactly what you want
→ **10-15 bits**

---

## Build Incrementally

Building one feature at a time is more efficient than requesting everything at once.

### Expensive (All at Once)

```
Build a complete fitness app with workout tracking,
meal plans, progress charts, social sharing,
achievements, and calendar integration
```
→ Huge plan, many errors, lots of fixes
→ **150+ bits**

### Efficient (Step by Step)

```
1. Start with workout logging (name, sets, reps)
2. Add exercise history view
3. Add progress charts
4. Add meal logging
5. etc.
```
→ Each step builds on stable foundation
→ **80-120 bits** total (same result)

---

## Use Reference Images

A picture really is worth a thousand ~~words~~ tokens.

### Without Image

```
I want a card layout where the image is on top,
then the title below it in bold, then a subtitle
in gray, and a price on the right side...
```
→ Multiple iterations to get it right
→ **50+ bits**

### With Image

```
Make my product cards look like this screenshot
[attached image]
```
→ AI sees exactly what you want
→ **15-25 bits**

### How to Use Images

1. Take a screenshot of any app/website you like
2. Drag and drop it into the Nativeline chat
3. Reference it in your prompt

---

## First-Time Success

Getting it right the first time saves bits.

### Before Sending a Prompt

1. **Be specific** — Include exact values, colors, sizes
2. **Be complete** — Mention all requirements upfront
3. **Be clear** — Describe the user experience, not just the UI

### The 30-Second Check

Before sending, ask yourself:
- Have I specified WHERE this should appear?
- Have I specified HOW it should look?
- Have I specified WHAT it should do?

This small investment prevents expensive iterations.

---

## Leverage Pro Plan Features

If you're on Pro plan, use the code editor for small changes.

### AI-Efficient

```
Add a settings screen with notification toggle
```
Use AI for new features and complex logic.

### Manual-Efficient

Open the code editor and change:
```swift
.foregroundColor(.blue)  // change to .green
.padding(16)              // change to 20
Text("Save")              // change to "Submit"
```

Save your bits for things that actually need AI.

---

## Optimize Error Handling

Errors consume bits. Reduce them.

### Preventive Prompting

```
Add a save button that saves the form data.
Include error handling if the save fails,
and show a loading indicator while saving.
```

Asking for error handling upfront prevents errors later.

### Quick Error Context

When errors occur, provide helpful context immediately:

```
The error says 'user' not found. It should use
'currentUser' from AuthManager.
```

Good context = faster fix = fewer bits.

---

## Batch Similar Changes

If you need multiple similar changes, batch them:

### Expensive (Separate Requests)

```
Change the home screen button to blue
```
then
```
Change the profile screen button to blue
```
then
```
Change the settings screen button to blue
```
→ **45+ bits** (3 separate operations)

### Efficient (One Request)

```
Change all buttons across the app to use blue (#007AFF)
as the primary color
```
→ **15 bits** (single operation)

---

## Know When to Start Fresh

Sometimes restarting is more efficient than fixing.

### Signs to Rebuild

- Same error returning repeatedly
- Multiple interconnected issues
- Fundamental architecture problem
- More than 5 fix attempts

### Efficient Restart

```
/planclear
Delete the [feature] code completely.
Let's rebuild it with a simpler approach: [description]
```

A clean rebuild often uses fewer bits than endless fixes.

---

## Smart Plan Management

### Don't Interrupt Plans

Let the AI complete its current plan before adding new requests. Interruptions can leave things half-done.

### Clear Plans When Pivoting

If you're changing direction:
```
/planclear
```

Then start fresh. Don't let old plans interfere.

### Review Before Execution

When the AI shows its plan, review it:
- Is this what you want?
- Is it the simplest approach?
- Should anything be different?

Feedback before implementation is cheaper than fixes after.

## Bit Usage by Action

### Low Bit Usage (1-10 bits)

- Simple questions
- Single color/text changes
- Spacing adjustments
- Single property changes

### Medium Bit Usage (10-25 bits)

- Multiple styling changes
- Minor bug fixes
- Small UI polish
- Simple additions

### High Bit Usage (25-50 bits)

- New components
- New screens
- Small features
- Multi-step changes

### Very High Bit Usage (50-100+ bits)

- Complete app builds
- Complex features
- Major bug investigations
- Large multi-file changes

---

## Tracking Your Usage

### Monitor in Real-Time

Check the bit counter in Nativeline's toolbar:
- Current remaining bits
- Usage trend
- Reset date

### Plan Your Sessions

If you have 200 bits left:
- ✅ Polish existing features
- ✅ Make small fixes
- ❌ Start a major new feature (save for after reset)

## Quick Reference

| Strategy | Savings |
|----------|---------|
| Specific prompts | 50-70% |
| Reference images | 40-60% |
| Building incrementally | 30-50% |
| Quick error context | 20-40% |
| Manual edits (Pro) | 90% for small changes |
| Batching similar changes | 30-50% |
