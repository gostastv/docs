    Note: Projects are stored locally on each Mac. To share projects:
    - Use iCloud Drive
    - Use Git/GitHub
    - Manually copy project folders
  </Accordion>

    Currently, changing your account email requires contacting support:

    1. Cancel any active subscription first
    2. Email support@nativeline.ai requesting deletion

## Data & Privacy

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Where is my data stored?">
    **Your projects:**
    - Stored locally on your Mac
    - In `~/Documents/Nativeline Projects/`
    - Not uploaded to our servers

    **Your account info:**
    - Email address and subscription status
    - Stored securely on our servers
    - Minimal data collection

    **AI interactions:**
    - Sent to AI providers for processing
    - Not stored long-term
    - Used only for the current session
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Nativeline see my code?">
    When you use the AI:
    - Your code is sent to AI providers (Anthropic, OpenAI)
    - This is necessary for the AI to help you
    - Code is processed and not stored long-term

    We don't look at your code ourselves. The AI providers have their own privacy policies.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use Nativeline offline?">
    Partially. You can:
    - Browse your existing projects
    - View code (Pro plan)
    - Run apps in Simulator (if already built)

    You cannot:
    - Use AI features (requires internet)
    - Upload to TestFlight

    AI features require an internet connection.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What does Nativeline collect about me?">
    We collect minimal data:
    - Email address (for authentication)
    - Subscription status
    - Basic usage metrics (how often you use features)

    We don't collect:
    - Your project code (unless using AI, then it's processed temporarily)
    - Personal browsing data
    - Location data
    - Contact information
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do you sell my data?">
    No. We don't sell your data to third parties. Your information is used only to provide the Nativeline service.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What about AI provider privacy?">
    When using AI features, your prompts and code are sent to:
    - Anthropic (Claude models)
    - OpenAI (if using BYOK with OpenAI key)

    These providers:
    - Process your data to generate responses
    - Have their own privacy policies
    - Generally don't train on API usage

    See their policies:
    - [Anthropic Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy)
    - [OpenAI Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is my payment info protected?">
    Nativeline uses Apple's payment system:
    - We never see your full card number
    - Payments are processed by Apple
    - Apple's security protects your payment info
    - We only receive confirmation of subscription status
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is my code encrypted?">
    - **In transit:** Yes, all connections use HTTPS/TLS
    - **On your Mac:** No additional encryption (use FileVault for disk encryption)
    - **On our servers:** We don't store your code

    Your projects are local files. Mac's built-in FileVault encrypts your disk.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How secure is email authentication?">
    Email verification is secure:
    - 8-digit codes are random and expire quickly
    - Codes are single-use
    - Your email inbox is the second factor
    - No passwords that can be stolen

    Ensure your email account itself is secure (use 2FA on your email).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should I use a strong email password?">
    Yes! Since your Nativeline account uses your email:
    - Use a strong, unique password for your email
    - Enable two-factor authentication on your email
    - Your email security is your Nativeline security
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can someone access my projects?">
    Your projects are on your Mac. To protect them:
    - Use a strong Mac password
    - Enable FileVault disk encryption
    - Lock your Mac when away
    - Back up important projects

    If someone has access to your Mac, they could access your projects.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I protect my API keys?">
    For API keys (OpenAI, Supabase, etc.):
    - Store in Settings → Integrations (not in code comments)
    - Don't commit to public Git repositories
    - Use different keys for test vs production
    - Rotate keys if you suspect compromise
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if my Mac is stolen?">
    If your Mac is lost or stolen:
    1. Use Find My Mac to locate or remotely wipe
    2. If FileVault was enabled, data is encrypted
    3. Change passwords for any accounts on that Mac
    4. Contact support if you need to secure your Nativeline account
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is Nativeline safe to use on shared computers?">
    Not recommended. On shared computers:
    - Others could access your projects
    - Others could access your account while logged in
    - Sensitive API keys could be exposed

    Use Nativeline on your personal Mac. Always log out if you must use a shared computer.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Backups

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I back up my projects?">
    **Manual backup:**
    - Copy project folders to external drive
    - Upload to cloud storage (Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud)

    **Automatic backup:**
    - Enable Time Machine on your Mac
    - Projects are included in regular backups

    **Version control:**
    - Initialize Git in project folder
    - Push to GitHub/GitLab
    - Best for ongoing work
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I lose my project files?">
    If you didn't back up:
    - Check Time Machine for previous versions
    - Look in iCloud Drive or other cloud services
    - Projects might be recoverable if recently deleted

    Unfortunately, we cannot recover projects since they're stored locally.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I sync projects across Macs?">
    Options for syncing:
    - **iCloud Drive:** Store project folder in iCloud
    - **Git:** Push/pull via GitHub
    - **External drive:** Manually copy
    - **Cloud storage:** Dropbox, Google Drive

    Be careful with simultaneous editing — use version control.
  </Accordion>
