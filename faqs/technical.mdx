# Technical FAQs

Questions about the technical aspects of Nativeline and iOS development.

---

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What programming language does Nativeline use?">
    Nativeline generates **Swift** code using **SwiftUI** for the user interface.

    - **Swift** — Apple's modern programming language
    - **SwiftUI** — Apple's declarative UI framework
    - Native iOS frameworks for device features

    These are the same technologies professional iOS developers use.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I see the code Nativeline generates?">
    Yes, with the **Pro plan**:
    1. Open your project
    2. Click "Code Editor" tab
    3. Browse all Swift files

    You can view, search, and even modify the code manually.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I edit the code myself?">
    Yes, with the **Pro plan**'s Code Editor. You can:
    - View all Swift source files
    - Make manual edits
    - Fix issues yourself
    - Add custom code

    Edits sync with the AI's understanding of your project.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where is my project code stored?">
    Projects are stored locally on your Mac:
    ```
    ~/Documents/Nativeline Projects/[Project Name]/
    ```

    Each project folder contains:
    - Swift source files (.swift)
    - Asset files (images, icons)
    - Xcode project file (.xcodeproj)
    - Configuration files
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I open the project in Xcode?">
    Yes. Navigate to your project folder and double-click the `.xcodeproj` file. This opens the project in Xcode where you can:
    - Make advanced modifications
    - Use Xcode-specific features
    - Debug with Xcode's tools

    Note: Extensive Xcode modifications may confuse Nativeline's AI.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use my project outside of Nativeline?">
    Yes. Your project is stored on your Mac in `~/Documents/Nativeline Projects/` and contains everything needed to:
    - Open in Xcode directly
    - Build independently
    - Hand off to a developer
    - Continue without Nativeline

    You own the code. There's no export needed and no vendor lock-in.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What iOS versions does my app support?">
    By default, apps target recent iOS versions (typically iOS 17+).

    You can tell the AI to support older versions:
    "Make this app support iOS 16 and later"

    Note: Older iOS support may limit available features.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Nativeline support iPad?">
    Yes! Apps automatically adapt to iPad. For specific iPad layouts:
    "Optimize the layout for iPad with a sidebar navigation"

    You can also create iPad-only apps or customize layouts per device.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is SwiftUI?">
    SwiftUI is Apple's modern UI framework that:
    - Uses declarative syntax (describe what you want)
    - Automatically handles many layout concerns
    - Works across all Apple platforms
    - Is the future of Apple development

    Nativeline generates SwiftUI code for your interfaces.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What about UIKit?">
    UIKit is Apple's older UI framework. Nativeline primarily uses SwiftUI but can use UIKit when needed:
    - Some features not yet in SwiftUI
    - Specific customization needs
    - Legacy integrations

    The AI handles which framework to use.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager?">
    Yes. The AI can add dependencies:
    - "Add the Alamofire networking library"
    - "Include the Kingfisher image loading package"

    Swift Package Manager is preferred for modern dependencies.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does data persistence work?">
    **Local storage options:**
    - **UserDefaults** — Simple key-value storage
    - **SwiftData** — Apple's modern ORM framework
    - **Core Data** — Older but powerful database

    **Cloud storage:**
    - **Supabase** — Recommended backend
    - **CloudKit** — Apple's iCloud service
    - **Custom APIs** — Your own server

    Tell the AI what kind of persistence you need.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can my app work offline?">
    Yes. For offline support:
    - Local storage for data (SwiftData, UserDefaults)
    - Cache remote data locally
    - Sync when connection returns

    Tell the AI: "Make this feature work offline and sync when connected"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I add push notifications?">
    Push notifications require:
    1. Apple Developer account
    2. Push capability enabled
    3. Backend to send notifications

    With Supabase or your own server:
    "Add push notifications for new messages"

    See [Capabilities](/features/capabilities) for setup.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use HealthKit or other Apple frameworks?">
    Yes! Most Apple frameworks are available:
    - **HealthKit** — Health data
    - **HomeKit** — Smart home
    - **SiriKit** — Voice commands
    - **ARKit** — Augmented reality
    - **Core ML** — Machine learning

    Tell the AI which framework to use. Some require capabilities enabled in Settings.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What about Core Data?">
    Nativeline can use Core Data, though SwiftData is preferred for new projects (it's simpler and more modern).

    If you specifically need Core Data:
    "Use Core Data instead of SwiftData for the database"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use animations?">
    Yes! SwiftUI has built-in animation support:
    - "Add a bounce animation when the button is tapped"
    - "Animate the transition between screens"
    - "Add a loading spinner animation"

    Custom animations, Lottie files, and more are possible.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I handle different screen sizes?">
    SwiftUI handles most responsive layout automatically. For specific needs:
    - "Make this layout responsive for all iPhones"
    - "Use a different layout on larger screens"
    - "Stack these items vertically on smaller phones"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I add in-app purchases?">
    Yes, using StoreKit:
    - "Add a premium upgrade as an in-app purchase"
    - "Create a subscription for $4.99/month"

    You'll need:
    - Apple Developer account
    - Products configured in App Store Connect
    - Testing with sandbox accounts
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is the code clean and maintainable?">
    Nativeline generates:
    - Well-structured Swift code
    - Appropriate separation of concerns
    - Standard iOS patterns (MVVM typically)
    - Comments where helpful

    A professional developer could take over the codebase.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I version control my project with Git?">
    Yes! The project folder is a standard file structure. You can:
    - Initialize a Git repository
    - Commit changes
    - Push to GitHub/GitLab
    - Collaborate with developers

    Just navigate to your project folder and use standard Git commands.
  </Accordion>
