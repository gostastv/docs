# General FAQs

Basic questions about what Nativeline is and who it's for.

---

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Nativeline?">
    Nativeline is a macOS app that lets you create native iOS apps using AI. You describe what you want in plain English, and the AI builds it for you. No coding experience required.

    The apps you create are real, native Swift apps that run on iPhones and can be published to the App Store.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Who is Nativeline for?">
    Nativeline is designed for:

    - **Entrepreneurs** who want to test app ideas quickly
    - **Small business owners** who need a mobile presence
    - **Creators** who want apps for their content/community
    - **Designers** who want to prototype without coding
    - **Developers** who want to speed up initial development

    No programming experience is needed, but having a clear idea of what you want to build helps.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to know how to code?">
    No. Nativeline is specifically designed for people who don't code. You describe what you want in everyday language, and the AI writes the code for you.

    However, if you do know how to code (or have a developer friend), the Pro plan includes a Code Editor where you can view and modify the generated Swift code.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What kind of apps can I build?">
    You can build a wide variety of iOS apps:

    - **Utility apps** — calculators, converters, timers
    - **Content apps** — news readers, portfolios, catalogs
    - **Social apps** — community features, messaging
    - **Productivity apps** — todo lists, note-taking, habit trackers
    - **E-commerce** — product catalogs, shopping carts (with Stripe)
    - **AI-powered apps** — chatbots, content generators (with OpenAI)

    Games with complex graphics are possible but more challenging. Simple games (quizzes, card games) work well.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are the apps real native apps?">
    Yes. Nativeline creates genuine Swift apps using Apple's native frameworks (SwiftUI, UIKit). These are the same technologies professional iOS developers use.

    Your apps:
    - Run natively on iPhones and iPads
    - Can use all iOS features (camera, location, notifications, etc.)
    - Can be published to the App Store
    - Are not web wrappers or cross-platform compromises
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I publish to the App Store?">
    Yes! Apps built with Nativeline can be submitted to the App Store just like any other iOS app. You'll need:

    - Apple Developer Program membership ($99/year)
    - To meet Apple's App Store Review Guidelines
    - Required metadata (screenshots, descriptions, etc.)

    See our [Publishing](/publishing/overview) section for complete guidance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Nativeline work on Windows or Linux?">
    No. Nativeline is a macOS-only application. This is because iOS app development requires Xcode and macOS—there's no way around this Apple requirement.

    You need:
    - macOS 15.1 (Sequoia) or later
    - Mac with Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3, M4) or Intel
    - At least 30GB free storage
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What makes Nativeline different from other app builders?">
    Key differences:

    1. **Native apps** — Real Swift code, not web wrappers
    2. **AI-powered** — Describe what you want, don't drag and drop
    3. **Full iOS access** — Camera, location, notifications, etc.
    4. **App Store ready** — Can publish like any native app
    5. **No vendor lock-in** — You own the generated code

    Unlike no-code platforms that create web apps wrapped in a native shell, Nativeline generates actual native iOS applications.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does the AI understand what I want?">
    Nativeline uses advanced AI (similar to ChatGPT) specifically trained for iOS app development. When you describe what you want, the AI:

    1. Understands your intent
    2. Breaks it into components
    3. Generates Swift/SwiftUI code
    4. Builds and runs the app

    The more specific you are, the better the results. Instead of "make a good app," try "create a recipe app where users can save their favorite recipes with photos."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use my own API keys?">
    Yes! The Pro plan includes a BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) feature. You can use your own:

    - Anthropic API key (Claude models)
    - OpenAI API key

    This gives you unlimited AI interactions beyond your monthly bits.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there a free trial?">
    You can download Nativeline and create your first project for free. This lets you see how the app works before committing.

    After that, you'll need a subscription to continue building.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I cancel my subscription?">
    Yes. You can cancel anytime from the Nativeline app: Settings → Account → Manage Subscription.

    After cancellation:
    - You keep access until the end of your billing period
    - Your projects remain on your Mac
    - You can export your code (Pro plan or higher)
    - You won't be able to use AI features or upload to TestFlight
