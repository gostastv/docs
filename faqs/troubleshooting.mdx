## Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Nativeline won't open">
    **Try these steps:**
    1. Check you have macOS 15.1 or later
    2. Right-click the app, choose "Open" to bypass Gatekeeper
    3. Go to System Settings → Privacy & Security → Allow Nativeline
    4. Restart your Mac and try again
    5. Re-download from nativeline.ai
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Xcode installation failed">
    **If Xcode install gets stuck:**
    1. Check internet connection
    2. Ensure at least 30GB free space
    3. Restart Nativeline — it should resume
    4. Check System Settings → Software Update for pending updates
    5. Try installing Xcode manually from App Store, then reopen Nativeline
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="'Mac not supported' error">
    You need macOS 15.1 (Sequoia) or later.

    To update:
    1. System Settings → General → Software Update
    2. Download and install the latest macOS
    3. Some older Macs may not support macOS 15

    Check Apple's compatibility list for your Mac model.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Not enough storage space">
    Nativeline + Xcode requires about 30GB.

    To free space:
    1. Empty Trash
    2. Delete old Downloads
    3. Use Storage Management (Apple menu → About This Mac → Storage → Manage)
    4. Remove unused apps
    5. Clear system caches
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Building Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Build keeps failing">
    **If the app won't build:**
    1. Check the error message in the build output
    2. Let the AI try to fix it (up to 3 attempts)
    3. Describe the error to the AI in your own words
    4. Try: `/planclear` to reset and start fresh
    5. As last resort, create a new project and rebuild

    See our [Debugging Guide](/guides/debugging) for detailed steps.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="AI tried 3 times but couldn't fix the error">
    When automatic fixing fails:
    1. Click "Run App" button
    2. Wait for the popup asking about fixing
    3. Click "Apply Fix"
    4. If still failing, describe the problem differently
    5. Try: "Let's try a completely different approach"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Simulator not showing">
    **If iOS Simulator doesn't appear:**
    1. Wait a moment — first launch takes time
    2. Check Dock for Simulator icon
    3. Nativeline menu → Window → Show Simulator
    4. Restart Nativeline
    5. Open Xcode → Open Developer Tool → Simulator to test directly
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Simulator shows wrong/old content">
    **To reset the Simulator:**
    1. In Simulator: Device → Erase All Content and Settings
    2. Wait for reset to complete
    3. Click "Run App" in Nativeline
    4. Fresh build should install

    This clears all cached app data.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="App crashes on launch">
    Common causes:
    - Missing permission descriptions (add in Settings → Permissions)
    - Invalid initial state
    - Missing data the app expects

    **Debug:**
    1. Check build output for crash log
    2. Tell the AI: "The app crashes on launch. Here's the error: [paste error]"
    3. The AI will analyze and fix
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Changes aren't appearing">
    **After AI makes changes:**
    1. Wait for the AI to finish completely
    2. Look for "Run App" button or wait for auto-run
    3. Watch for build output
    4. Check Simulator after build succeeds

    If still not appearing, erase Simulator content and rebuild.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## AI Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="AI isn't understanding what I want">
    **Tips for better results:**
    1. Be more specific — include details
    2. Break into smaller requests
    3. Try rephrasing your request
    4. Share a screenshot of what you want
    5. Say "That's not right, I wanted X instead"

    See [Prompt Writing Workshop](/guides/prompt-workshop) for techniques.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="AI keeps making the same mistake">
    **When AI is stuck in a loop:**
    1. Type `/planclear` to clear the current plan
    2. Say "Let's try a completely different approach"
    3. Be more specific about what's wrong
    4. Break the task into smaller pieces
    5. Provide examples or reference images
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="AI says 'completed' but created 0 files">
    Sometimes the AI reports completion but nothing was actually created, and the plan stays active (not checked off).

    **To fix this:**
    1. Type `/planclear` to clear the stuck plan
    2. Re-request the feature with different wording
    3. The AI will start fresh and complete the task

    This can happen occasionally when the AI misinterprets the request. Rephrasing usually resolves it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="AI seems slow">
    Possible reasons:
    - Complex request taking time
    - Server load (try again later)
    - Large project context being processed

    The AI shows a loading indicator while working. Complex tasks take more time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="'Out of bits' error">
    You've used your monthly bit allocation.

    **Options:**
    - Wait for monthly reset
    - Upgrade to a higher plan
    - Use BYOK feature (Pro plan) with your own API key

    Check your usage in Settings → Account.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Publishing Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Upload to TestFlight failed">
    **Common causes:**
    1. Check internet connection
    2. Verify Apple Developer account is connected
    3. Ensure Bundle ID matches App Store Connect
    4. Check for missing app icon (1024x1024)
    5. Try resetting signing certificates in Settings

    See [TestFlight Troubleshooting](/publishing/testflight/troubleshooting) for more.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Build stuck in 'Processing'">
    Apple processing can take 10-30 minutes, sometimes longer.

    **If longer than 2 hours:**
    1. Check [Apple System Status](https://developer.apple.com/system-status/)
    2. Upload a new build with incremented number
    3. Wait up to 24 hours before contacting Apple
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="App rejected by App Store">
    **Handle rejection:**
    1. Read the rejection reason carefully
    2. Fix each issue mentioned
    3. Upload new build if code changes needed
    4. Reply in Resolution Center
    5. Resubmit for review

    See [Review Guidelines](/publishing/app-store/review-guidelines) to avoid common rejections.

## Performance Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Nativeline is slow">
    **To improve performance:**
    1. Close other heavy applications
    2. Restart Nativeline
    3. Restart your Mac
    4. Check Activity Monitor for resource usage
    5. Ensure enough free storage (at least 10GB)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Mac is running hot">
    Building apps uses significant CPU. This is normal, but:
    1. Work in a well-ventilated area
    2. Close unnecessary apps
    3. Take breaks between heavy build sessions
    4. Check that fans are working (Activity Monitor)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Builds taking too long">
    **Speed up builds:**
    1. Close other applications
    2. Quit and reopen Nativeline occasionally
    3. First build is always slowest
