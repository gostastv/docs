# Building Apps FAQs

Questions about using the AI to build your apps.

---

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I tell the AI what I want?">
    Just type in plain English! Be specific about:
    - What the feature should do
    - What it should look like
    - How users should interact with it

    **Good prompt:** "Add a profile screen with the user's photo, name, and email. Include an 'Edit Profile' button that opens an edit form."

    **Less effective:** "Make it better"

    See our [Prompt Writing Workshop](/guides/prompt-workshop) for detailed guidance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How specific do I need to be?">
    The more specific, the better. Instead of:
    - ❌ "Add a list"
    - ✅ "Add a scrolling list of recipes with an image, title, and cooking time for each"

    Think about what you would tell a human developer. Include:
    - What you want
    - Where it should appear
    - How it should behave
    - Any specific styling
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I share images or screenshots with the AI?">
    Yes! You can:
    - Paste screenshots of designs you like
    - Share mockups or wireframes
    - Show examples of apps for inspiration
    - Share error screenshots for debugging

    Drag images directly into the chat or use Cmd+V to paste.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why did the AI misunderstand me?">
    Common reasons:
    - Prompt was too vague
    - Request conflicted with existing code
    - Technical limitation the AI didn't explain

    **Fix:** Be more specific, or try rephrasing. Say "That's not what I meant. I wanted X instead of Y."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I undo what the AI did?">
    Several options:
    1. Tell the AI: "Undo that last change"
    2. Be specific: "Remove the feature you just added"
    3. Describe what you want instead

    The AI maintains history and can reverse changes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is a 'plan' and why does the AI make one?">
    For complex requests, the AI creates an internal plan to organize its work. The AI works automatically without showing visible plan steps — you'll see code previews and tool cards as it builds.

    If the AI seems stuck or going in the wrong direction, you can use `/planclear` to clear the current plan and start fresh. Use `/plan` to check the current plan status.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What does /planclear do?">
    The `/planclear` command clears the AI's current plan, allowing you to:
    - Start fresh if the AI is going in the wrong direction
    - Reset after a complex feature is complete
    - Clear outdated context

    Type `/planclear` in the chat and press Enter.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I continue where I left off?">
    The AI remembers your project context. Just say:
    - "Continue" — Resumes the last plan
    - "What were we working on?" — Gets a summary
    - Start a new request — Begins fresh

    Project memory persists across sessions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why is the Simulator showing an old version?">
    The Simulator might have cached data. Try:
    1. In Simulator: Device → Erase All Content and Settings
    2. Rebuild by clicking "Run App"
    3. Wait for the fresh build to install

    Also make sure the latest build was successful.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why is my app not updating when I make changes?">
    Changes don't appear until you rebuild. After the AI makes changes:
    1. Wait for it to finish
    2. Click "Run App" or wait for auto-run
    3. Check the Simulator for updates

    If still not updating, try erasing Simulator content.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can the AI make my app faster?">
    Yes! Ask it to:
    - "Optimize the performance of [feature]"
    - "The app feels slow when [action]. Make it faster."
    - "Reduce the loading time for [screen]"

    Be specific about what feels slow.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can the AI fix bugs?">
    Yes. The AI can:
    - Analyze errors automatically
    - Attempt to fix bugs (up to 3 automatic attempts)
    - Accept your description of issues

    For bugs, describe:
    - What happens
    - What should happen
    - Steps to reproduce

    See our [Debugging Guide](/guides/debugging) for more.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens when the AI can't fix a bug?">
    After 3 automatic fix attempts:
    1. Press "Run App"
    2. A popup appears
    3. Click "Apply Fix" — the AI automatically analyzes and attempts a new fix

    If automatic fixing isn't working, you can also:
    - Message the AI describing the problem in your own words
    - Try a different approach
    - Ask the AI to revert and try something else
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I add a backend to my app?">
    For data that needs to sync across devices or persist in the cloud, use Supabase:

    1. Create a Supabase account
    2. Connect it in Settings
    3. Ask the AI to add features using Supabase

    See our [Supabase](/integrations/supabase/overview) documentation for detailed guides.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I integrate external APIs?">
    Yes! You can integrate:
    - OpenAI for AI features
    - Stripe for payments
    - Weather APIs
    - Any REST API

    Tell the AI: "Integrate [API name] to [what you want to do]" and provide your API key.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the best way to build a complex feature?">
    Break it into smaller pieces:

    1. Describe the overall goal
    2. Let the AI create a plan
    3. Review the plan before proceeding
    4. Build incrementally
    5. Test each piece before moving on

    Complex features are more successful when built step by step.
