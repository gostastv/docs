# Billing & Plans FAQs

Questions about Nativeline's pricing, bits, and subscription plans.

---

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How much does Nativeline cost?">
    Nativeline offers three plans:

    | Plan | Price | Bits |
    |------|-------|------|
    | Basic | $30/month | 600 bits |
    | Standard | $60/month | 1,400 bits |
    | Pro | $120/month | 3,500 bits + Code Editor |

    Annual plans offer a discount. See [Plans & Pricing](/introduction/plans-and-pricing) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are bits?">
    Bits are Nativeline's usage currency. They're consumed when the AI works on your app:
    - Questions and explanations (1-5 bits)
    - Color/text changes (10-15 bits)
    - Creating new features (25-40 bits)
    - Full app build (40-60 bits)

    Your bit balance is shown in the app and resets monthly with your subscription.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How many bits do I need?">
    It depends on how much you build. As a rough guide:

    | Usage | Bits/Month |
    |-------|------------|
    | Light (exploring, 1-2 apps) | 50-150 |
    | Moderate (building regularly) | 150-400 |
    | Heavy (multiple complex apps) | 500+ |

    Start with the Builder plan. You can always upgrade if you need more.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens when I run out of bits?">
    When bits are depleted:
    - AI features stop working
    - You can still run and test your current app
    - You can view your code (Pro plan)
    - You cannot make new AI-powered changes

    Options:
    - Wait for monthly reset
    - Upgrade to a higher plan
    - Use BYOK with your own API key (Pro plan)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do unused bits roll over?">
    No. Bits reset at the start of each billing cycle. There's no rollover of unused bits.

    Plan your usage to maximize your monthly allocation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I buy extra bits?">
    Not directly. To get more bits, you can:
    - Upgrade to a higher plan
    - Use the BYOK feature (Pro plan) with your own API key

    BYOK gives you unlimited AI interactions beyond your monthly bits.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)?">
    BYOK lets Pro plan users connect their own AI API keys:
    - Anthropic (Claude models)
    - OpenAI (GPT models)

    With BYOK:
    - AI interactions use your API key, not bits
    - Unlimited AI usage (you pay API provider directly)
    - Bits are preserved for when you don't use BYOK

    Set up in Settings → API Keys.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I track my bit usage?">
    Check your usage:
    - In the app: Look for bit counter in the interface
    - Settings → Account shows detailed usage
    - Watch for low-bit warnings as you approach your limit
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there a free tier?">
    You can download Nativeline and explore for free. This lets you:
    - See the interface
    - Create a project
    - Understand how it works

    To build apps with AI, you need a subscription.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I cancel my subscription?">
    Yes, anytime. To cancel:
    1. Open Settings → Account
    2. Click "Manage Subscription"
    3. Cancel through Apple's subscription management

    After cancellation:
    - You keep access until the end of your billing period
    - Your projects stay on your Mac
    - You can export code (Pro plan)
    - AI features stop working after the period ends
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I upgrade or downgrade?">
    1. Open Settings → Account
    2. Click "Manage Subscription"
    3. Choose a different plan

    - Upgrades take effect immediately
    - Downgrades take effect at next billing cycle
    - Bits are prorated for upgrades
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I get a refund?">
    Refunds are handled through Apple since subscriptions are processed via the App Store.

    To request a refund:
    1. Go to [reportaproblem.apple.com](https://reportaproblem.apple.com)
    2. Sign in with your Apple ID
    3. Select the Nativeline charge
    4. Request a refund

    Apple's policies determine refund eligibility.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to pay Apple's $99/year separately?">
    Yes. The Apple Developer Program ($99/year) is separate from Nativeline's subscription.

    - Nativeline = for building apps
    - Apple Developer = for publishing to TestFlight and App Store

    You only need the Apple Developer account when you're ready to distribute your app.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are there student or educational discounts?">
    Currently, Nativeline doesn't offer student discounts. However:
    - The Basic plan is affordable for learning
    - You can build real apps while learning
    - Consider it an investment in a valuable skill

    Watch for promotional offers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What payment methods are accepted?">
    Nativeline uses Apple's payment system. You can pay with anything linked to your Apple ID:
    - Credit/debit cards
    - Apple Pay
    - Apple ID balance
    - Gift cards
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When does my subscription renew?">
    Subscriptions renew automatically on the same date each month (or year for annual plans).

    Check your renewal date:
    1. Settings → Account
    2. Or in iPhone/Mac Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions
