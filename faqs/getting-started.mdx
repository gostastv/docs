<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What Mac do I need?">
    Nativeline requires:
    - **macOS 15.1 (Sequoia)** or later
    - Any Mac with **Apple Silicon** (M1, M2, M3, M4 chips) or **Intel**
    - At least **30GB free storage** (for Xcode and tools)
    - **8GB RAM** minimum (16GB recommended)

    Not sure what you have? Click the Apple menu → About This Mac.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I install Nativeline?">
    1. Download from [nativeline.ai](https://nativeline.ai)
    2. Open the downloaded file
    3. Drag Nativeline to your Applications folder
    4. Open Nativeline from Applications

    On first launch, Nativeline will automatically install Xcode and other required tools. This can take 15-30 minutes depending on your internet speed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why does the first launch take so long?">
    Nativeline automatically installs the iOS development tools on first launch:
    - **Xcode** — Apple's development environment (~15GB)
    - **Command Line Tools** — Additional development utilities
    - **iOS Simulator** — For testing your apps

    This is a one-time process. Subsequent launches are quick.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to install Xcode myself?">
    No. Nativeline automatically installs Xcode for you during the first launch. Just make sure you have enough storage space (at least 30GB free) and a stable internet connection.

    If you already have Xcode installed, Nativeline will use your existing installation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I create an account?">
    1. Open Nativeline
    2. Click "Create Account"
    3. Enter your email address
    4. Check your email for an 8-digit verification code
    5. Enter the code in Nativeline
    6. You're in!

    We use email-only authentication for simplicity and security.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I didn't receive the verification code">
    Try these steps:
    1. Check your spam/junk folder
    2. Wait 2-3 minutes (email can be delayed)
    3. Click "Resend Code" in Nativeline
    4. Make sure you typed your email correctly

    If still having issues, contact support@nativeline.ai.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I create my first app?">
    1. Click "New Project"
    2. Give your project a name
    3. Type a description of what you want to build
    4. Press Enter and watch the AI work!

    Start simple. Try: "Create a counter app with plus and minus buttons."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where are my projects saved?">
    Projects are saved in:
    ```
    ~/Documents/Nativeline Projects/
    ```

    Each project is a folder containing:
    - Swift source code
    - Asset files
    - Configuration files
    - Everything needed to build the app
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I open an existing project?">
    Yes. Go to File → Open Project and navigate to your project folder.

    You can also:
    - Double-click a .xcodeproj file
    - Drag a project folder onto the Nativeline icon
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if my Mac goes to sleep during installation?">
    The installation will pause but should resume when your Mac wakes up. If it seems stuck:
    1. Restart Nativeline
    2. The installation should continue where it left off
    3. If needed, Nativeline will re-download any corrupted files
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I'm getting a 'Mac not supported' error">
    This means your macOS version is too old. You need macOS 15.1 (Sequoia) or later.

    To update:
    1. Open System Settings
    2. Go to General → Software Update
    3. Download and install the latest macOS

    Note: Some older Macs may not support macOS 15. Check Apple's compatibility list.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I switch between projects?">
    - File → Open Recent to see recent projects
    - File → Open Project to browse
    - Close current project first to avoid confusion

    Each project opens in a separate window.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I work on multiple projects at once?">
    Yes, but we recommend focusing on one project at a time. Each project runs its own Simulator and uses system resources.

    For best performance, close projects you're not actively working on.
  </Accordion>
