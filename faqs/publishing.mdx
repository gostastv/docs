# Publishing FAQs

Questions about getting your app to users via TestFlight and the App Store.

---

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need an Apple Developer account?">
    **For testing on your own device:** No, but apps expire after 7 days.

    **For TestFlight or App Store:** Yes, you need an Apple Developer Program membership ($99/year).

    There's no way around this for distribution. It's an Apple requirement for all iOS apps.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much does the Apple Developer account cost?">
    $99 per year for individuals.

    Organizations also pay $99/year but need a D-U-N-S number (free to obtain but takes 1-2 weeks).

    The fee covers:
    - TestFlight distribution
    - App Store publishing
    - Access to developer tools and betas
    - 2 technical support incidents
  </Accordion>

    | Audience | Invited testers | Everyone |
    | Limit | 10,000 testers | Unlimited |
