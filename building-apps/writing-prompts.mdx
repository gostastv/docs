# Writing Effective Prompts

The quality of your prompts directly affects the quality of your app. This guide teaches you how to communicate with Nativeline's AI to get exactly what you want, every time.

## The Golden Rules

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Be Specific" icon="bullseye">
    Vague prompts get vague results. Details matter.
  </Card>
  <Card title="One Thing at a Time" icon="1">
    Focus on a single feature or change per message.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Describe the Experience" icon="user">
    Tell the AI what users should see and do.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Provide Context" icon="lightbulb">
    Reference existing elements by name or description.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Rule 1: Be Specific

The more specific you are, the better results you get.

### Bad Examples

<Warning>
  These prompts are too vague:
  - "Make it look better"
  - "Fix the design"
  - "Add some features"
  - "Make it more modern"
</Warning>

### Good Examples

<Check>
  These prompts give the AI what it needs:
  - "Add rounded corners (12 points) to all cards and a subtle drop shadow"
  - "Change the navigation bar color to dark blue (#1a365d)"
  - "Add a favorite button (heart icon) in the top-right corner of each item"
  - "Use San Francisco font at 17pt for body text with 24pt line height"
</Check>

### The Difference

| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| "Change the color" | "Change the header background to warm orange (#FF8C42)" |
| "Make it bigger" | "Increase the font size to 24 points" |
| "Add a button" | "Add a circular blue '+' button in the bottom-right corner" |
| "Fix the layout" | "Center the title horizontally and add 20 points of padding on the sides" |

## Rule 2: Describe the User Experience

Don't just describe what you want - describe what the **user** experiences.

### Less Effective

> "Add a timer"

### More Effective

> "Add a countdown timer that shows minutes and seconds in large, bold text. When the timer reaches zero, play a gentle chime sound and show a 'Time's up!' message in the center of the screen. The user should be able to tap anywhere to dismiss the message."

### Why This Works

The second prompt tells the AI:
- What the user sees (large bold text)
- What happens at zero (sound + message)
- How the user interacts (tap to dismiss)

This context helps the AI build a complete, polished feature.

---

## Rule 3: Reference What Exists

Always reference existing elements by name or description.

### Less Effective

> "Change the color"

The AI doesn't know which color you mean - there might be dozens of colors in your app.

### More Effective

> "Change the blue header background at the top of the home screen to a warm orange"

### How to Reference Elements

- **By location:** "the button at the bottom of the settings screen"
- **By function:** "the save button"
- **By appearance:** "the blue card with the user's name"
- **By screen:** "on the profile page"

---

## Rule 4: Break Down Complex Features

Instead of asking for everything at once, build incrementally.

### Less Effective

> "Build a complete task management system with projects, tags, due dates, recurring tasks, subtasks, priorities, and team collaboration"

This is too much for one request. The AI may get confused or miss details.

### More Effective

Build step by step:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with basics">
    "Create a task list where I can add items with a title"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add completion">
    "Add checkboxes to mark tasks as complete. Completed tasks should appear faded with a strikethrough"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add due dates">
    "Let me set a due date for each task. Show it in small gray text under the title. Highlight overdue tasks in red"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add priorities">
    "Add three priority levels: high (red dot), medium (yellow dot), low (no dot). Let me tap to change priority"
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Why This Works

- Each step can be tested before moving on
- Errors are easier to isolate and fix
- The AI builds on a solid foundation
- You use fewer bits overall (fewer re-dos)

## Rule 5: Provide Visual References

Attach images to show the AI what you want.

### When to Use Images

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="UI Mockups" icon="pen-ruler">
    Sketches, wireframes, or design files
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reference Apps" icon="mobile">
    Screenshots from apps you like
  </Card>
  <Card title="Color Palettes" icon="palette">
    Images showing your desired colors
  </Card>
  <Card title="Bug Reports" icon="bug">
    Screenshots showing what's wrong
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Example Prompt with Image

> "Here's a screenshot of Spotify's playlist screen. I want my music list to look similar - dark background, album art on the left, song title and artist stacked on the right."
>
> [attached screenshot]

---

## Rule 6: Describe Edge Cases

Think about what happens in unusual situations.

### Basic Prompt

> "Add a search feature"

### Complete Prompt

> "Add a search bar at the top of the list. As the user types, filter the results in real-time. If no results match, show 'No results found' with a magnifying glass icon. When the search bar is empty, show all items. Add a clear button (X) on the right side of the search bar."

### Edge Cases to Consider

- What happens when the list is empty?
- What if the user types something with no matches?
- What if the data is still loading?
- What happens on very small or very large screens?
- What if the user cancels an action?

## 20+ Example Prompts

### Adding Screens

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Settings Screen">
    "Create a settings screen with sections for Account, Notifications, and Appearance. Each section should have a header and list of toggles. Add a Sign Out button at the bottom in red."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Profile Screen">
    "Add a profile screen showing the user's avatar (large circle at top), name, email, and member since date. Below that, show their stats: total items, completed items, and current streak."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Onboarding">
    "Create a 3-screen onboarding flow. Each screen has an illustration placeholder, a title, and a short description. Include dots at the bottom to show progress. The last screen has a 'Get Started' button."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Changing Design

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cards and Shadows">
    "Make all cards have rounded corners (16pt radius), a subtle shadow (2pt blur, 10% opacity black), and 16pt padding inside. The background should be white in light mode and dark gray in dark mode."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Typography">
    "Update the typography: Titles should be 24pt bold, subtitles 18pt medium, body text 16pt regular, and captions 12pt regular in gray. Use SF Pro throughout."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Color Scheme">
    "Change the color scheme to use deep purple (#5B21B6) as the primary color, with light purple (#A78BFA) for secondary elements. Keep text black/white for contrast."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Adding Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Favorites">
    "Add a heart icon to each item. Tapping it toggles favorite status (filled = favorite, outline = not). Add a 'Favorites' tab that shows only favorited items."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Search">
    "Add a search bar at the top of the list. Filter items in real-time as the user types. Show 'No results' with an empty state illustration when nothing matches."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Swipe Actions">
    "Add swipe-to-delete on list items. Swiping left reveals a red 'Delete' button. Show a confirmation alert before actually deleting."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Pull to Refresh">
    "Add pull-to-refresh to the main list. Show a loading spinner while refreshing. Display a brief 'Updated' message when complete."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Data & Storage

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Local Persistence">
    "Save the user's items locally so they persist when the app closes. Use SwiftData for storage."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="User Preferences">
    "Save the user's theme preference (light/dark/system), notification settings, and default list view. Use UserDefaults for these settings."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cloud Sync">
    "Connect to Supabase and sync the user's items to the cloud. Show a sync indicator when uploading changes."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Fixing Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Layout Problems">
    "The text is getting cut off on smaller screens. Make the content scrollable and ensure text wraps properly instead of being truncated."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Navigation Issues">
    "When I tap the back button, it goes to the wrong screen. It should return to the home screen, not the settings screen."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Styling Issues">
    "The button text is hard to read because the text color is too similar to the background. Change the text to white for better contrast."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Animations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Button Press">
    "Add a subtle scale animation when buttons are pressed - shrink to 95% on press, return to 100% on release. Make it feel snappy (0.1 second)."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="List Items">
    "Animate list items appearing when the screen loads. Each item should fade in and slide up slightly, with a small delay between each item."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Page Transitions">
    "When navigating between screens, use a smooth horizontal slide transition instead of the default."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## What NOT to Do

<Warning>
  **Avoid these common mistakes:**
</Warning>

### Don't Be Vague

- ❌ "Make it prettier"
- ✅ "Add more spacing between elements and softer colors"

### Don't Overload a Single Request

- ❌ "Add login, signup, forgot password, profile, settings, and logout"
- ✅ Start with "Add a login screen with email and password fields"

### Don't Assume the AI Remembers Everything

- ❌ "Use the same style as before"
- ✅ "Use rounded corners and shadows like we did on the home screen cards"

### Don't Skip Testing

- ❌ Ask for 10 features, then wonder why something is broken
- ✅ Build and test one feature at a time

## Saving Bits with Better Prompts

Better prompts = fewer retries = fewer bits used.

<Tip>
  **Save bits by:**
  - Being specific the first time (avoids "no, I meant...")
  - Breaking down complex features (catch issues early)
  - Testing each feature before adding more
  - Using images for visual requirements
</Tip>
