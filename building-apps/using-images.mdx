# Using Images

A picture is worth a thousand words - especially when building apps. Nativeline lets you attach images to guide the AI, making it easier to get exactly the design you want.

## How to Attach Images

### Drag and Drop

The easiest way:
1. Find an image in Finder, your browser, or any app
2. Drag it directly into the chat area
3. Drop it to attach

### File Size & Limits

- **Maximum images per message:** 5
- **Supported formats:** PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, HEIC
- Images are processed and understood by the AI

<Tip>
  You can drag multiple images at once - just select them all and drop.
</Tip>

## When to Use Images

### UI Mockups & Wireframes

Share your design ideas visually:

  Hand-drawn wireframes work great. The AI understands rough layouts and can translate them into code.
</Card>

<Card title="Figma/Sketch Exports" icon="paintbrush">
  Export your designs as PNG and attach them. Include any specific details in your text prompt.
</Card>

<Card title="Whiteboard Photos" icon="chalkboard">
  Even photos of whiteboard sketches help the AI understand your vision.

### Reference Screenshots

Show the AI apps you like:

> "I want my settings screen to look like this screenshot from the Apple Settings app - grouped sections with toggles."
>
> [attached screenshot]

Great sources for reference:
- Apps on your phone (take a screenshot)
- Dribbble or Behance designs
- Competitor apps
- Apple's built-in apps

### Color Palettes

Share exact colors:

> "Use this color palette for the app. The dark blue is for headers, teal for buttons, and light gray for backgrounds."
>
> [attached color palette image]

### Bug Reports

Show exactly what's wrong:

> "Here's a screenshot of the issue. The button is overlapping the text at the bottom."
>
> [attached screenshot showing the bug]

### App Icons & Assets

Share images to use in your app:

> "Use this logo as the app icon. It should appear in the top-left of the home screen too."
>
> [attached logo PNG]

## Best Practices

### Always Add Context

Don't just drop an image - explain what you want:

<Warning>
  **Less helpful:**
  Just an image with no text
</Warning>

<Check>
  **More helpful:**
  "Here's my wireframe for the profile screen. The avatar should be a large circle at the top. Below that, show the user's name and email. The stats row should use the icon + number format I sketched."

### Be Specific About What to Copy

When sharing reference screenshots:

<Warning>
  **Vague:**
  "Make it look like this"
</Warning>

<Check>
  **Specific:**
  "I like three things from this screenshot:
  1. The card design with subtle shadows
  2. The spacing between elements
  3. The way the icons are aligned with the text

  Use a similar approach for my app's list items."
</Check>

### Annotate When Helpful

Add arrows, circles, or notes to your screenshots:

- Circle the element you're referring to
- Draw arrows pointing to specific areas
- Add text labels for clarity

You can use Preview on Mac, or screenshot tools like Skitch or CleanShot.

### Multiple Images for Complex Requests

For multi-screen flows, attach multiple images:

> "Here's the user flow for checkout:
> 1. First image: Cart screen with items
> 2. Second image: Shipping form
> 3. Third image: Payment screen
> 4. Fourth image: Confirmation
>
> Each screen should flow naturally to the next with a 'Continue' button."

## Common Image Use Cases

### Recreating an Existing Design

> "I have a Figma mockup of my app. Here's the home screen design - please implement it exactly as shown, including the fonts, colors, and spacing."
>
> [attached Figma export]

### Matching Another App's Style

> "I love how Airbnb displays listings. See the attached screenshot - I want my items displayed in a similar card format with the image taking up the full width at the top."
>
> [attached Airbnb screenshot]

### Showing What's Wrong

> "The layout is broken on my screen. Compare the first image (what I expected) with the second image (what I'm seeing). The button should be at the bottom, not in the middle."
>
> [attached: expected.png, actual.png]

### Providing Color Specifications

> "Here's the brand style guide. Use these exact hex colors: primary blue (#0066CC), accent orange (#FF8C00), background gray (#F5F5F5)."
>
> [attached style guide image]

### Icon & Asset Integration

> "Use this custom icon set for the tab bar. From left to right: home, search, favorites, profile."
>
> [attached: icon set PNG]

## Tips for Better Results

### High Quality Images

- Clear, high-resolution images work best
- Crop out unnecessary parts
- Make sure important details are visible

### Consistent Style

If sharing multiple references, try to keep a consistent style. Mixing wildly different aesthetics can confuse the AI.

### Be Patient with Complex Designs

Intricate designs may require multiple iterations:
1. Start with the layout
2. Refine colors and fonts
3. Add detailed styling
4. Polish animations and interactions

### Combine Images with Text

The best results come from images + detailed descriptions:

> "Here's a mockup of my dashboard (attached). Let me describe what each section does:
>
> - **Header**: Shows today's date and a greeting
> - **Stats row**: Four cards with key metrics (these should be tappable)
> - **Recent activity**: A scrollable list of the latest items
> - **Bottom nav**: Four tabs matching the icons I sketched"
