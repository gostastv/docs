# The Chat Interface

The chat interface is where you spend most of your time in Nativeline. It's your command center for building, testing, and refining your iOS app.

## Workspace Overview

When you open a project, you'll see the main workspace divided into sections:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Toolbar (project name, settings, account)                  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                    │                                        │
│   Sidebar          │         Main Content Area              │
│   (tabs)           │         (chat or other views)          │
│                    │                                        │
│   - Chat           │   ┌─────────────────────────────────┐  │
│   - Settings       │   │  Conversation History           │  │
│   - Database       │   │                                 │  │
│   - Deploy         │   │  Your messages (right)          │  │
│                    │   │  AI responses (left)            │  │
│                    │   │  Tool cards                     │  │
│                    │   │  Todo lists                     │  │
│                    │   └─────────────────────────────────┘  │
│                    │                                        │
│                    │   ┌─────────────────────────────────┐  │
│                    │   │  Message Input                  │  │
│                    │   └─────────────────────────────────┘  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## The Sidebar Tabs

### Chat Tab
Your primary workspace. This is where you communicate with the AI to build your app.

### Settings Tab
Configure your app's identity, permissions, and capabilities. See [Project Settings](/features/project-settings) for details.

### Database Tab
View and manage your Supabase database tables (if connected). See [Database](/features/database) for setup.

### Deploy Tab
Publish your app to TestFlight for beta testing. See [TestFlight](/features/testflight) for the full guide.

## The Conversation Area

### Your Messages

When you type a message and send it, your message appears on the **right side** of the conversation. Each message shows:
- Your text
- Any images you attached
- A timestamp

### AI Responses

The AI's responses appear on the **left side**. Responses can include:

#### Text Explanations
The AI explains what it's doing, answers questions, or asks for clarification.

#### Tool Cards
When the AI creates or edits files, you'll see **tool cards** that show:
- The operation (Create, Edit, Read)
- The file path
- What changed

Example tool card:
```
📝 Edit File
ContentView.swift
Added new button with blue background
```

#### Todo Lists
For complex requests, the AI creates a **todo list** showing:
- Steps to complete
- Current progress
- Completed items (checked off)

This gives you visibility into what the AI is working on.

#### Code Previews
When code is being generated, you may see:
- Real-time code appearing in a preview panel
- Syntax highlighting for Swift
- The file being edited

## Sending Messages

### Basic Input

Type your message in the input box at the bottom of the chat and:
- Press **Enter** to send
- Press **Shift+Enter** for a new line (multi-line messages)
- Press **Cmd+Enter** for quick send

### Attaching Images

You can drag and drop images directly into the chat:
- Up to **5 images** per message
- Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, HEIC

See [Using Images](/building-apps/using-images) for tips on when and how to use visual references.

### Message Tips

<Tip>
  **Be specific.** Instead of "make it better," try "increase the button size to 50 points and add a subtle shadow."
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **One thing at a time.** For best results, ask for one feature or change per message. This helps the AI focus and reduces errors.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Reference what exists.** Say "change the blue header" instead of "change the header color" so the AI knows exactly what you mean.
</Tip>

## Understanding AI Responses

### When Things Are Working

You'll see:
- A todo list with items being checked off
- Tool cards showing files being created/edited
- Your app rebuilding in the Simulator
- A success message when done

### When Things Go Wrong

Sometimes builds fail. When this happens:
1. The AI automatically detects the error
2. It shows you what went wrong
3. It proposes a fix
4. After your approval, it applies the fix and rebuilds

Don't panic - errors are normal, and Nativeline handles most of them automatically.

### When the AI Needs Clarification

If your request is ambiguous, the AI may ask questions:
- "Did you mean the header at the top or the section title?"
- "What color did you have in mind for the button?"
- "Should this save to the device or to the cloud?"

Just answer naturally, and the AI will continue.

## The Simulator Preview

While you're chatting, the iOS Simulator runs on the right side of your screen (or in a separate window). This gives you:

- **Instant feedback** - See changes as soon as builds complete
- **Real interaction** - Tap, scroll, and use your app like a real user
- **Error visibility** - See crashes or UI issues immediately

### Build Status

Watch for these indicators:
- **Building...** - Your app is compiling
- **Success** - App is running in Simulator
- **Error** - Build failed (AI will help fix it)

## Conversation Management

### Scrolling Through History

Your entire conversation is saved. Scroll up to see:
- Previous requests
- What the AI built
- Earlier iterations

This is helpful for understanding how your app evolved.

### Starting Fresh

If your conversation gets too long or you want a clean slate:
1. Look for the **Clear Conversation** option
2. Confirm you want to clear
3. Start fresh (your app and files are preserved)

<Note>
  Clearing the conversation doesn't delete your app - it only clears the chat history. Your code and project files remain intact.
</Note>

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| Send message | Enter |
| New line in message | Shift+Enter |
| Quick send | Cmd+Enter |

## Pro Tip: The Code Preview

When the AI is writing code, you can watch it in real-time in the code preview panel. This helps you:
- Understand what's being created
- Catch issues before the build completes
- Learn Swift by seeing what the AI writes
