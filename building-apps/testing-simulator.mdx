# Testing in the Simulator

The iOS Simulator is a virtual iPhone running on your Mac. Every time you make changes in Nativeline, your app automatically builds and runs in the Simulator so you can see the results instantly.

## What is the iOS Simulator?

The iOS Simulator is part of Xcode. It creates a virtual iPhone (or iPad) on your Mac that behaves just like a real device:

- Tap on the screen (with mouse clicks)
- Scroll through content (with trackpad or mouse)
- Type text (with your keyboard)
- Test all your app's features

<Note>
  The Simulator runs iOS, but it's not a perfect replica of a physical device. Some features like the camera, accelerometer, and push notifications behave differently.
</Note>

## Automatic Build & Launch

Nativeline handles the entire build process for you:

<Steps>
  <Step title="You make a request">
    Ask the AI to add a feature or make a change.
  </Step>
  <Step title="AI generates code">
    Watch as the AI creates or edits files.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build starts automatically">
    Nativeline compiles your app in the background.
  </Step>
  <Step title="App launches in Simulator">
    If the build succeeds, your app opens in the virtual iPhone.
  </Step>
  <Step title="You test the changes">
    Interact with your app to verify everything works.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Build Status Indicators

Watch for these status messages:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Building...** | Your app is being compiled. Wait a moment. |
| **Success** | Build complete! App is running in Simulator. |
| **Error** | Something went wrong. The AI will help fix it. |

### When Builds Fail

Don't worry - build errors are normal and expected. When a build fails:

1. **Nativeline detects the error** automatically
2. **The AI analyzes** what went wrong
3. **A fix is proposed** in the chat
4. **You approve** and the AI applies the fix
5. **The build runs again**

Most errors are fixed within 1-2 attempts. If an error persists, try describing the issue in your own words.

## Interacting with Your App

### Basic Interactions

| Action | How to Do It |
|--------|-------------|
| Tap | Click with mouse |
| Scroll | Two-finger trackpad scroll, or mouse wheel |
| Long press | Click and hold |
| Swipe | Click, hold, and drag |
| Type | Use your Mac keyboard |

### Keyboard Shortcuts in Simulator

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Cmd+Shift+H | Go to home screen |
| Cmd+L | Lock screen |
| Cmd+S | Take screenshot |
| Cmd+K | Toggle software keyboard |
| Cmd+1/2/3 | Change Simulator window size |

## Testing Checklist

Before you consider a feature complete, test these scenarios:

### Functionality
- [ ] Does the feature work as expected?
- [ ] Do buttons and taps respond correctly?
- [ ] Does data save and persist?
- [ ] Do navigation flows work?

### Edge Cases
- [ ] What happens with empty data?
- [ ] What if text is very long?
- [ ] What about very short content?
- [ ] Does it handle errors gracefully?

### Different Screen Sizes
- [ ] Test on iPhone SE (small screen)
- [ ] Test on iPhone 16 Pro Max (large screen)
- [ ] Check text doesn't get cut off
- [ ] Verify layouts adapt properly

### Light and Dark Mode
- [ ] Test with light appearance
- [ ] Test with dark appearance
- [ ] Ensure text is readable in both

## Changing Simulator Device

To test on different iPhone models:

1. In the Simulator menu, go to **File → Open Simulator**
2. Choose a different device (e.g., iPhone SE, iPhone 16 Pro Max)
3. Your app will build and run on the new device

<Tip>
  Test on both the smallest (iPhone SE) and largest (Pro Max) screens to catch layout issues.
</Tip>

## Changing Appearance (Light/Dark Mode)

To test dark mode:

1. In the Simulator, go to **Features → Toggle Appearance**
2. Or use the keyboard shortcut **Cmd+Shift+A**

This switches between light and dark mode instantly.

## Resetting the Simulator

If your app gets into a weird state:

1. Go to **Device → Erase All Content and Settings**
2. Confirm the reset
3. The Simulator restarts fresh
4. Rebuild your app from Nativeline

## Troubleshooting the Simulator

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Simulator doesn't appear" icon="eye-slash">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Simulator window is behind other windows
    - Simulator is still launching (can take 30+ seconds first time)
    - iOS Simulator not installed

    **Solutions:**
    - Check other desktops/spaces for the Simulator window
    - Wait longer for first-time launch
    - Install iOS Simulator via Xcode → Settings → Platforms
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Simulator is very slow" icon="clock">
    **Possible causes:**
    - First launch after restart
    - Low system memory
    - Too many apps/processes running

    **Solutions:**
    - Wait for Simulator to fully boot
    - Close other applications
    - Restart your Mac
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="App doesn't update after changes" icon="rotate">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Build failed silently
    - Cached version still running

    **Solutions:**
    - Check for build errors in Nativeline
    - Stop the app in Simulator and rebuild
    - Reset Simulator (Device → Erase All Content)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Wrong device type showing" icon="mobile">
    **Solution:**
    - Go to File → Open Simulator and choose the device you want
    - Nativeline will use whatever Simulator is currently open
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keyboard not appearing" icon="keyboard">
    **Cause:**
    The Simulator uses your Mac keyboard by default, so the on-screen keyboard is hidden.

    **Solutions:**
    - Toggle software keyboard with **Cmd+K**
    - Or just type directly with your Mac keyboard
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Testing vs. Real Device

The Simulator is great for most testing, but keep in mind:

| Simulator | Real Device |
|-----------|-------------|
| Uses Mac CPU (faster) | Uses iPhone CPU |
| Mouse clicks ≠ finger taps | Real touch interaction |
| No camera, GPS, sensors | Full hardware access |
| Unlimited battery | Battery life matters |
| Mac network speed | Cellular conditions vary |

For final testing before publishing, you'll want to test on a real iPhone via TestFlight. See [Publishing to TestFlight](/features/testflight) for details.

## Pro Tips

<Tip>
  **Test early and often.** Don't wait until you've added many features to test. Check after each change to catch issues early.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use the keyboard.** It's much faster to type with your Mac keyboard than tapping the on-screen keyboard.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Test edge cases.** What happens with no data? Lots of data? Very long text? These are the scenarios where bugs hide.
