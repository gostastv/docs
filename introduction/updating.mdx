### When Xcode Needs Updating

- Nativeline will notify you if a newer Xcode version is required
- Updates happen automatically when needed
- Large updates may take time to download

### Manual Xcode Updates

If needed, you can update Xcode manually:
1. Open **Xcode** from Applications (or via Spotlight)
2. Follow any update prompts
3. Or update via **System Settings → Software Update**

<Note>
  Xcode updates can be large (several GB). Ensure you have sufficient disk space and a stable internet connection.
