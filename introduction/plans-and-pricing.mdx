# Plans & Pricing

Nativeline offers flexible plans to match how you build. Whether you're exploring, building your first app, or shipping products, there's a plan for you.

## Understanding Bits

Nativeline uses a **bits** system to measure AI usage. Bits are your monthly AI budget — think of them like data on a phone plan.

When the AI thinks, plans, writes code, or debugs, it uses bits. More complex tasks use more bits.

### How Bits Are Consumed

| Action | Approximate Bits |
|--------|------------------|
| Simple question | 1-5 bits |
| Change a color or text | 10-15 bits |
| Add a simple component (button, field) | 25-40 bits |
| Create a new screen | 30-50 bits |
| Build a complex feature | 40-80 bits |
| Debug stubborn errors | 15-50 bits (varies) |

### Why Usage Varies

Bit consumption depends on:
- **Complexity** — More complex features = more AI thinking
- **Specificity** — Vague requests require more iterations
- **Errors** — Build failures trigger debugging cycles
- **Project size** — Larger projects need more context processing

<Tip>
  Specific, clear prompts use fewer bits than vague requests. "Add a blue button with white text" is cheaper than "make it look better."
</Tip>

## Choosing Your Plan

### Decision Guide

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I'm just exploring Nativeline" icon="magnifying-glass">
    **Start with Builder ($25/month)**

    1,000 bits gives you enough to:
    - Build 10-15 complete apps
    - Experiment freely with features
    - Learn how the AI works without worrying about limits

    You'll have plenty of bits to explore and learn.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I'm building my first real app" icon="seedling">
    **Builder ($25) or Pro ($50)**

    For a first app, expect to use 50-150 bits total. Consider:
    - **Builder** if you just want the app built
    - **Pro** if you want to see and learn from the code

    Pro is worth it if you're curious about how things work.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I want to see and edit the code" icon="code">
    **Pro ($50/month) or higher**

    The code editor lets you:
    - View all generated Swift code
    - Make quick edits yourself
    - Read logs for debugging
    - Learn Swift by doing

    Code access requires Pro, Scale, or BYOK.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I'm building multiple apps or complex features" icon="layer-group">
    **Scale ($100+/month)**

    Building several apps or one ambitious project? Scale lets you:
    - Choose exactly how many bits you need
    - Get priority support
    - Access new features early

    Calculate your needs: Simple app ≈ 50-100 bits. Complex app ≈ 150-300 bits.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I use AI constantly and want unlimited" icon="bolt">
    **BYOK ($15/month + API costs)**

    If you're building daily, BYOK is most cost-effective. You pay:
    - $15/month to Nativeline (platform access)
    - Actual usage to Anthropic (typically $20-100/month)

    Heavy users often spend $35-115/month total — less than Scale for high usage.

## Example: Building a Task Manager

Here's what building a complete app might cost in bits:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial creation (~40 bits)">
    "Create a task list app with add and complete features"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add due dates (~25 bits)">
    "Add due dates to tasks with a date picker"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fix a bug (~15 bits)">
    "Tasks aren't saving when I close the app"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Polish design (~10 bits)">
    "Make the cards have rounded corners and shadows"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add categories (~30 bits)">
    "Add categories like Work, Personal, Shopping"
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Total: ~120 bits** (Builder plan covers 8+ apps like this!)

A more complex app with cloud sync, user accounts, and multiple screens might use 200-400 bits.

## Managing Your Bits

### Checking Usage

Your remaining bits are always visible in Nativeline:
- Look for the bits indicator in the toolbar
- A progress bar shows usage percentage
- Warning appears at 80% usage
- Bits reset monthly on your billing date

### When Bits Run Low

**At 80% usage:**
- Warning notification appears
- Consider upgrading or being more efficient

**At 100% usage:**
- AI features pause until reset
- Your projects remain safe
- You can still open and view your code
- Bits reset on your billing date

  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Images" icon="image">
    Attach screenshots or mockups — visual context saves iterations
  </Card>
  <Card title="Build Incrementally" icon="stairs">
    Add features one at a time, testing each before moving on

## BYOK Deep Dive

Bring Your Own Key is for users who want unlimited AI usage.

### How It Works

1. Create an account at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
2. Generate an API key
3. Enter the key in Nativeline settings
4. Pay $15/month to Nativeline for platform access
5. Pay Anthropic directly for your actual API usage

### Anthropic Pricing (as of 2024)

| Model | Input Cost | Output Cost |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| Claude 3.5 Haiku | $0.25/million tokens | $1.25/million tokens |
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet | $3/million tokens | $15/million tokens |

For context:
- 1 million tokens ≈ 750,000 words
- A typical feature request uses 2,000-5,000 tokens
- A full building session uses 50,000-200,000 tokens

### Typical BYOK Costs

| Usage Level | Hours/Week | Monthly API Cost |
|-------------|------------|------------------|
| Light | 2-3 hours | $5-15 |
| Moderate | 5-10 hours | $20-50 |
| Heavy | 20+ hours | $50-100+ |

Plus the $15 Nativeline platform fee.
