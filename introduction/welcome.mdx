## What You Can Build

Nativeline creates **real, native iOS apps** — not prototypes or web wrappers. Your apps run natively on iPhones and iPads with full access to iOS features.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Describe Your App">
    Tell the AI what you want to build in plain English. "Create a recipe app where I can save my favorite meals" is all you need.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Watch It Build">
    Nativeline writes real Swift code, creates your UI, and handles all the technical complexity automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Instantly">
    Your app runs in the iOS Simulator on your Mac. See your changes in real-time as you iterate.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Refine and Polish">
    Ask for changes, add features, fix issues — the AI handles it all. Keep refining until it's perfect.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish to the App Store">
    When you're ready, Nativeline helps you submit to TestFlight and the App Store.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why Nativeline?

### Real Native Apps
Unlike no-code builders that create web wrappers, Nativeline generates genuine Swift code using Apple's SwiftUI framework. Your apps are indistinguishable from those built by professional developers.

### No Coding Required
You never need to write code. The AI handles everything — from UI components to data storage to complex features. Just describe what you want.

### Full Control When You Want It
On Pro plans and above, access the full code editor. View, learn from, and even edit the Swift code yourself.

### From Idea to App Store
Nativeline covers the entire journey: building, testing, debugging, and publishing. Everything happens in one app.
