# Installing Nativeline

Getting started with Nativeline takes just a few minutes. Download, install, and you're ready to build.

## First Launch

When you open Nativeline for the first time, everything you need is installed automatically.

### Automatic Setup

Nativeline downloads and installs all required development tools:

- **Xcode** — Apple's developer tools (~12GB)
- **Command Line Tools** — Build utilities
- **iOS Simulator** — For testing your apps

This happens automatically in the background. You'll see progress indicators as components are installed.

<Note>
  First launch takes longer due to downloading Xcode (~12GB). Make sure you have a stable internet connection and at least 20GB of free disk space.
</Note>

### What You'll See

1. **Progress indicators** as Xcode downloads
2. **Brief welcome animation** introducing Nativeline
3. **Home page** when setup is complete

Once setup finishes, you're ready to start building.

## The Home Page

After setup, you'll land on the Home Page where you can:

- **Create a new app** — Start a fresh project
- **Open existing projects** — Continue where you left off
- **Access account settings** — Manage your plan and preferences
