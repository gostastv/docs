## What Gets Installed Automatically

When you first launch Nativeline, it automatically installs everything needed to build iOS apps:

### Xcode (~12GB)
Apple's complete development environment. Nativeline downloads and installs this automatically.

### Command Line Tools
Build utilities required for compiling Swift code.

### iOS Simulator
Virtual iPhones and iPads for testing your apps without a physical device.

<Note>
  First launch takes 15-30 minutes depending on your internet speed due to the Xcode download. This only happens once.
</Note>

## What You DON'T Need

Nativeline handles everything for you. You don't need:

- ❌ Previous programming experience
- ❌ Xcode installed manually
- ❌ Command line knowledge
- ❌ Apple Developer account (until publishing)
- ❌ Physical iPhone or iPad (Simulator is included)

---

## Network Requirements

Nativeline requires internet access for:

- **AI features** — All building happens via cloud AI
- **First launch** — Downloading Xcode and dependencies
- **Updates** — App and dependency updates
- **Account** — Authentication and subscription

### Firewall & VPN

If you're on a corporate network or using a VPN:
- Ensure access to `nativeline.ai`
- Ensure access to Apple's servers for Xcode downloads

## Performance Tips

### For Faster Builds

1. **Use Apple Silicon** — M1/M2/M3 Macs build significantly faster
2. **Close unused apps** — Free up RAM for the build process
3. **Use SSD storage** — All modern Macs have SSDs, but external drives may be slower
4. **Keep macOS updated** — Latest versions include performance improvements

### For Better Simulator Performance

1. **Choose simpler devices** — iPhone SE runs faster than iPhone 15 Pro Max
2. **Close other Simulators** — Only run one at a time
3. **Restart occasionally** — Fresh simulator boots run better

### For Stable AI Connection

1. **Use wired internet if possible** — More stable than WiFi for long sessions
2. **Avoid saturated networks** — Other heavy downloads can cause timeouts
3. **Check connection before long sessions** — Ensure stable connectivity
