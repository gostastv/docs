# Create Your First App

Let's build something! This guide walks you through creating your first iOS app with Nativeline. You'll go from an idea to a working app in the iOS Simulator in just a few minutes.

## Step 1: Describe Your Idea

When you open Nativeline, you'll see the Home Page with a text box asking:

> **"Tell me about the app you're imagining..."**

This is where the magic starts. Just type what you want to build in plain English. Don't worry about technical details - describe it like you're explaining it to a friend.

### Example Ideas

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Habit Tracker" icon="check-circle">
    "A habit tracker that lets me build streaks and see my progress over time"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Recipe Organizer" icon="utensils">
    "A recipe app where I can save and organize my favorite meals with photos"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Meditation Timer" icon="brain">
    "A meditation timer with calming sounds and session history"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Expense Tracker" icon="wallet">
    "A simple expense tracker that helps me stay on budget each month"
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  Start simple! You can always add more features later. A focused initial description leads to better results.
</Tip>

## Step 2: The Wizard

After you submit your idea, Nativeline's wizard helps customize your app with a few quick questions:

### Question 1: Who is this for?

Choose your audience:
- **Just me** - A personal app for your own use
- **A small group** - Family, friends, or your team
- **Anyone (public app)** - Ready for the App Store

This helps the AI understand the scope and polish level needed.

### Question 2: What feel do you want?

Pick a design direction:
- **Simple & clean** - Minimalist, focused, no distractions
- **Modern & polished** - Contemporary design with smooth animations
- **Bold & expressive** - Vibrant colors, strong typography
- **Dark & minimal** - Sleek dark theme, subtle accents
- **Something else** - Describe your own vision

### Question 3: Similar apps? (Optional)

Have apps that inspire you? Mention them:
> "I love how Notion organizes content" or "Something like the Apple Fitness app"

This gives the AI concrete examples to learn from.

### Question 4: What's your priority?

What matters most right now?
- **Core functionality first** - Get the features working, polish later
- **Visual polish** - Make it look beautiful from the start
- **Just get it working** - Speed over perfection

### Question 5: Pick a color palette

Choose from curated palettes or let the AI generate one:
- **Vibrant Sunset** - Warm oranges and reds
- **Ocean Blues** - Cool blues and teals
- **Forest Green** - Natural greens and browns
- **Midnight Purple** - Deep purples and blacks
- **AI Generated** - Based on your app description

### Question 6: Name your app

Give your creation a name! This becomes:
- The app's display name
- The folder name for your project
- The title in the App Store (if you publish)

<Note>
  You can change the name later in Project Settings if you think of something better.
</Note>

## Step 3: Watch the Magic

After completing the wizard, Nativeline gets to work:

1. **Creating your Xcode project** - Sets up all the technical foundations
2. **Setting up the app structure** - Creates the initial screens and navigation
3. **Building based on your description** - Generates the first version of your app

You'll see a loading animation while this happens. It typically takes 30 seconds to a minute.

## Step 4: Your Workspace

Once your project is ready, you'll enter the main workspace. This is where you'll spend most of your time:

### The Chat Interface

On the left side, you'll see a chat area. This is how you communicate with the AI:
- **Your messages** appear on the right
- **AI responses** appear on the left
- **Tool cards** show files being created or edited
- **Todo lists** show what the AI is working on

### The Preview

On the right side, you'll see your app running in the iOS Simulator - a virtual iPhone on your Mac. Every time the AI makes changes, the app rebuilds and you can see the results instantly.

## Step 5: Make It Yours

Now the fun begins! Chat with the AI to add features and customize your app:

### Adding Features

Just ask for what you want:
- "Add a settings screen where I can change the theme"
- "Create a way to save items as favorites"
- "Add a button to share content"

### Changing Design

Describe visual changes:
- "Make the buttons rounder with a subtle shadow"
- "Change the header background to dark blue"
- "Use a larger font for the main title"

### Fixing Issues

If something doesn't work right:
- "The list isn't scrolling properly"
- "The button color is wrong, it should be green"
- "The text is cut off on smaller screens"

<Tip>
  The more specific you are, the better results you'll get. See our [Writing Prompts](/building-apps/writing-prompts) guide for expert tips.
</Tip>

## Your First Request

Try asking the AI to add something to your app. Here's a simple first request:

> "Add a 'Hello World' message in big, bold text in the center of the screen"

Watch as the AI:
1. Creates a plan
2. Writes the code
3. Builds your app
4. Shows the result in the Simulator

Congratulations - you just built your first feature without writing a single line of code!
