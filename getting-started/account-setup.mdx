# Account Setup

Your Nativeline account lets you save projects, track usage, and access premium features. Here's how to get set up.

## Creating an Account

When you create your first app (or try to access account features), you'll be prompted to create an account.

### Option 1: Email Signup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter your email">
    Type your email address in the signup form.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check your inbox">
    You'll receive a 6-digit verification code within a minute.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter the code">
    Type the code into Nativeline to verify your email.
  </Step>
  <Step title="You're in!">
    Your account is created and ready to use.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Check your spam folder if you don't see the verification email. It comes from nativeline.dev.
</Tip>

### Option 2: Sign in with Apple

The fastest way to create an account:

1. Click **Sign in with Apple**
2. Authenticate with Face ID, Touch ID, or your password
3. Choose whether to share or hide your email
4. You're done!

2. Select your Google account
3. Authorize Nativeline
4. Your account is created

## Choosing a Plan

Nativeline uses a "bits" system to measure AI usage. Different plans give you different amounts of bits each month.

### Understanding Bits

Bits represent your AI usage budget. Here's roughly how they're consumed:

| Action | Approximate Bits |
|--------|-----------------|
| Simple change (color, text) | 10-50 bits |
| New feature | 100-500 bits |
| Complete new screen | 500-1,000 bits |
| Complex feature with data | 1,000+ bits |

## Managing Your Account

### Checking Your Usage

Your remaining bits are displayed in the Nativeline app:
- Look for the usage indicator in the toolbar
- A warning appears when you've used 80% of your bits
- Bits reset monthly on your billing date

### Upgrading Your Plan

To upgrade:
1. Click on your profile or **Settings**
2. Select **Plans** or **Subscription**
3. Choose a new plan
4. Confirm your upgrade

Upgrades take effect immediately, and you'll receive a prorated credit for your current plan.

### Downgrading Your Plan

You can also downgrade:
1. Go to **Settings → Plans**
2. Select a lower tier plan
3. Confirm the change

<Warning>
  Downgrading from Pro or higher means losing code editor access. Make sure you don't have unsaved edits before downgrading.
</Warning>

### Canceling Your Subscription

If you need to cancel:
1. Go to **Settings → Subscription**
2. Click **Cancel Subscription**
3. Confirm cancellation

Your access continues until the end of your current billing period. Your projects remain saved locally on your Mac.

## Account Security

- **Projects** are stored locally on your Mac in `~/Documents/Nativeline Projects/`
- **Account info** is stored securely in our cloud

### Signing Out

To sign out:
1. Click your profile
2. Select **Sign Out**

Signing out doesn't delete your local projects - they stay on your Mac.

### Deleting Your Account

To delete your account entirely:
1. Contact support@nativeline.dev
