## First Launch

When you open Nativeline for the first time:

### Automatic Setup

Nativeline automatically downloads and installs everything needed to build iOS apps:

- **Xcode** - Apple's developer tools
- **Command Line Tools** - Build utilities
- **iOS Simulator** - For testing your apps

This happens automatically in the background. You'll see progress indicators as components are installed.

<Note>
  The first launch takes longer due to downloading Xcode (~12GB). Make sure you have a stable internet connection and enough disk space.
</Note>

### Welcome Screen

A brief animated introduction shows you what Nativeline can do. You can skip this if you're eager to start building.

### Home Page

Once setup is complete, you'll land on the Home Page where you can:
- Create a new app
- Open existing projects
- Access your account settings
