## Step 2: Install Xcode

Nativeline needs Xcode to build your iOS apps. If you don't have it installed, Nativeline will prompt you.

### Option A: Automatic Prompt

When you first launch Nativeline, it checks for Xcode. If missing, you'll see a prompt with a button to download it directly from the App Store.

### Option B: Manual Installation

1. Open the **Mac App Store**
2. Search for **Xcode**
3. Click **Get** (it's free, but large - about 12GB)
4. Wait for the download and installation to complete
5. Open Xcode once to accept the license agreement
6. Restart Nativeline

<Warning>
  Xcode is a large download (12GB+). Make sure you have a stable internet connection and enough disk space.
</Warning>

## Step 3: First Launch

When you open Nativeline for the first time, you'll go through a quick setup:

### Welcome Screen

A brief animated introduction shows you what Nativeline can do. You can skip this if you're eager to start building.

### Xcode Verification

Nativeline checks that:
- Xcode is installed
- Command-line tools are available
- iOS Simulator is ready

If anything is missing, you'll see clear instructions on how to fix it.

### Dependency Check

Nativeline verifies all required components are in place. This usually completes automatically within a few seconds.

### Home Page

Once everything is ready, you'll land on the Home Page where you can:
- Create a new app
- Open existing projects
- Access your account settings
