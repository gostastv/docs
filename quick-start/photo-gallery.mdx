# Photo Gallery Tutorial

**⏱️ 30 minutes**

Build a photo gallery app that captures photos and displays them beautifully. You'll learn about camera access, photo library permissions, and image handling.

## What You'll Build

A photo gallery app that:
- Takes photos with the camera
- Selects photos from the library
- Displays photos in a grid
- Opens photos in full screen
- Saves photos locally

---

## Part 1: Create the App

On the Nativeline home page, enter:

```
A photo gallery app where I can take photos with the camera or choose from my photo library. Display all photos in a grid, and tap to view full screen.
```

### Complete the Wizard

- **Who is this for?** — Just me
- **Feel** — Modern & polished
- **Priority** — Core functionality first
- **Colors** — Any palette (photos will be the focus)
- **Name** — Photo Gallery

Wait for the build to complete.

## Part 2: Set Up Permissions

Photos and camera require permissions. Let's make sure they're configured:

```
Make sure the app requests camera and photo library permissions when needed. Add appropriate permission descriptions explaining why we need access.
```

The app should now request permissions when you try to take or select photos.

<Note>
  In the Simulator, you can't use the actual camera, but you can select from the photo library. The camera will work on a real device via TestFlight.
</Note>

---

## Part 3: Improve the Photo Grid

Let's make the gallery look professional:

```
Display photos in a 3-column grid with small gaps between photos. Photos should be square and fill the screen edge-to-edge. Add a subtle animation when new photos are added.
```

---

## Part 4: Add Photo Buttons

Make it easy to add photos:

```
Add a floating "+" button in the bottom right corner. When tapped, show an action sheet with two options:
- "Take Photo" (opens camera)
- "Choose from Library" (opens photo picker)
```

---

## Part 5: Add Full Screen View

Let users view photos in detail:

```
When I tap a photo in the grid, open it full screen with:
- Black background
- Photo fills the width, centered vertically
- Pinch to zoom
- Swipe left/right to see other photos
- X button to close
```

---

## Part 6: Add Photo Deletion

Let users remove photos:

```
In the full screen view, add a trash button that deletes the photo after confirming. Show an alert asking "Delete this photo?" with Cancel and Delete options.
```

---

## Part 7: Make Photos Persistent

Save photos so they survive app restarts:

```
Save all photos locally so they persist when the app is closed and reopened. Store them in the app's documents directory.
```

Test persistence:
1. Add a few photos
2. Close and reopen the app
3. Photos should still be there

---

## Part 8: Add Empty State

Handle the case when there are no photos:

```
When the gallery is empty, show a friendly message:
- A camera icon
- "No photos yet"
- "Tap + to add your first photo"
```

---

## Part 9: Add Photo Info (Optional)

Show metadata for each photo:

```
In the full screen view, add an info button that shows:
- Date photo was added
- Photo dimensions
- File size
```

---

## Part 10: Add Albums (Optional)

Organize photos into albums:

```
Add the ability to create albums:
- Tab bar with "All Photos" and "Albums"
- Albums tab shows list of albums
- Tap to create new album with a name
- Long press photos in grid to select and add to album
```

---

## Part 11: Add Photo Editing (Optional)

Basic photo editing:

```
In full screen view, add an edit button that opens editing options:
- Rotate left/right
- Crop to square
- Apply filters (black & white, sepia, vivid)
Save edits back to the photo.
```

---

## Final Result

You now have a complete photo gallery with:
- ✅ Camera capture
- ✅ Photo library selection
- ✅ Grid display
- ✅ Full screen viewing with zoom
- ✅ Photo deletion
- ✅ Local persistence
- ✅ Empty state
- ✅ (Optional) Photo info
- ✅ (Optional) Albums
- ✅ (Optional) Editing

## Testing Tips

### In the Simulator

The Simulator doesn't have a real camera, but you can:
- Select from the sample photo library
- Drag images from your Mac onto the Simulator to add them to the library

### On a Real Device

To test the camera, you'll need to:
1. Deploy to TestFlight (see [Publishing](/publishing/overview))
2. Install on your iPhone
3. Test camera functionality there

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Camera option not working in Simulator" icon="camera">
    The Simulator can't access a real camera. The camera option will work when you test on a real device. For now, use "Choose from Library" instead.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="No photos in the Simulator library" icon="images">
    Add sample photos to the Simulator:
    - Drag images from Finder onto the Simulator window
    - They'll be saved to the photo library
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Photos not persisting" icon="database">
    Make sure you asked for local persistence:
    "Save photos to the app's documents directory so they persist"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Grid looks wrong" icon="grid">
    Specify exact layout:
    "Use a LazyVGrid with 3 flexible columns and 2pt spacing"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Permission denied" icon="lock">
    Reset permissions in Simulator:
    Device → Erase All Content and Settings
  </Accordion>

## Challenge: Extend Your App

Try these on your own:

1. **Sharing** — Share photos to other apps
2. **Favorites** — Mark photos as favorites with a heart
3. **Search by date** — Filter photos by when they were taken
4. **Slideshow** — Auto-play through photos
5. **Cloud backup** — Sync to Supabase storage
