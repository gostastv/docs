## Tips for Success

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start simple, add complexity" icon="stairs">
    Begin with basic functionality. Once it works, add features one at a time. This approach uses fewer bits and creates more stable apps.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Be specific in your prompts" icon="bullseye">
    Instead of "make it look better," say "add 16pt padding and rounded corners to the cards." Specific requests get better results and use fewer bits.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test as you go" icon="vial">
    After each change, interact with your app in the Simulator. Catching issues early is easier than fixing them later.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use the todo list" icon="list-check">
    Watch the AI's todo list to understand what it's doing. If something seems wrong, you can give feedback before it finishes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Don't be afraid to iterate" icon="rotate">
    Your first version won't be perfect — and that's fine! Building apps is iterative. Keep refining until you're happy.
  </Accordion>
