# Weather App Tutorial

**⏱️ 45 minutes**

Build a weather app that shows current conditions and forecasts. You'll learn about API integration, location services, and displaying real-time data.

## What You'll Build

A weather app that:
- Shows current weather for your location
- Displays temperature, conditions, and other details
- Shows a multi-day forecast
- Lets you search for other cities

---

## Before You Start

This tutorial uses a weather API to get real data. You have two options:

### Option A: Use WeatherKit (Recommended)
Apple's built-in weather service. No API key needed, but requires iOS 16+ and works automatically.

### Option B: Use OpenWeather API
Free tier available at [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/api). Requires creating an account and getting an API key.

For this tutorial, we'll use **WeatherKit** since it's simpler.

---

## Part 1: Create the App

On the Nativeline home page, enter:

```
A weather app that shows the current weather for my location. Display temperature, weather condition (sunny, cloudy, etc.), and a 5-day forecast. Use Apple's WeatherKit.
```

### Complete the Wizard

- **Who is this for?** — Just me
- **Feel** — Modern & polished
- **Priority** — Core functionality first
- **Colors** — Ocean Blues (or your choice)
- **Name** — Weather

Wait for the build to complete.

## Part 2: Set Up Location Permission

Your app needs permission to access location. Nativeline should have set this up, but let's verify:

```
Make sure the app requests location permission when it first opens. Show a loading state while getting weather data.
```

When you run the app in the Simulator:
1. You'll see a permission popup for location
2. Tap "Allow While Using App"
3. The app should fetch weather for the Simulator's default location

<Tip>
  To change the Simulator's location: Features → Location → Custom Location (or choose a city)
</Tip>

---

## Part 3: Improve the Current Weather Display

Let's make the current weather look better:

```
Redesign the current weather section:
- Large temperature display (72°F format)
- Weather condition icon (sun, cloud, rain, etc.)
- Condition text (Partly Cloudy)
- High/low temperatures for today
- "Feels like" temperature
- Location name at the top
```

Your main weather display should now be informative and visually clear.

---

## Part 4: Add Weather Details

Add more weather information:

```
Below the main temperature, add a horizontal row of weather details:
- Humidity percentage
- Wind speed and direction
- UV index
- Visibility

Use icons for each and show the value below.
```

---

## Part 5: Improve the Forecast

Let's enhance the 5-day forecast:

```
Show the 5-day forecast as horizontal scrolling cards:
- Each card shows the day name, weather icon, and high/low temps
- Use a slightly different background for each card
- Make today's card highlighted
```

Or for a different layout:

```
Show the 5-day forecast as a vertical list:
- Day of week on the left
- Weather icon in the middle
- High temp / low temp on the right
- Alternating row backgrounds
```

---

## Part 6: Add City Search

Let users check weather for other cities:

```
Add a search bar at the top that lets me search for cities. When I tap a city from the search results, show the weather for that location instead of my current location.
```

Test searching for cities like "New York," "London," or "Tokyo."

---

## Part 7: Add Pull to Refresh

Let users manually refresh the weather:

```
Add pull-to-refresh to update the weather data. Show a loading indicator while refreshing.
```

Pull down in the Simulator to test it.

---

## Part 8: Add Background Based on Weather

Make it visually dynamic:

```
Change the background gradient based on the current weather:
- Sunny: Yellow to blue gradient
- Cloudy: Gray gradient
- Rainy: Dark blue to gray
- Night: Dark purple to black

Also adjust text colors for readability.
```

---

## Part 9: Add Hourly Forecast (Optional)

Show hour-by-hour weather:

```
Add an hourly forecast section between current weather and daily forecast. Show the next 12 hours as a horizontal scrolling row with:
- Hour (3 PM)
- Small weather icon
- Temperature
```

---

## Part 10: Add Weather Alerts (Optional)

Display severe weather warnings:

```
If there are any weather alerts for the current location, show a warning banner at the top with the alert type and a button to read more details.
```

---

## Final Result

You now have a complete weather app with:
- ✅ Current location weather
- ✅ Temperature and conditions
- ✅ 5-day forecast
- ✅ Weather details (humidity, wind, etc.)
- ✅ City search
- ✅ Pull to refresh
- ✅ Dynamic backgrounds
- ✅ (Optional) Hourly forecast
- ✅ (Optional) Weather alerts

## What You Learned

| Concept | How It Was Used |
|---------|-----------------|
| **APIs** | Fetching weather data from WeatherKit |
| **Location** | Getting device coordinates |
| **Permissions** | Requesting location access |
| **Async data** | Loading states and refreshing |
| **Search** | City lookup and selection |
| **Dynamic UI** | Backgrounds based on conditions |

## Using OpenWeather API Instead

If you prefer OpenWeather (or WeatherKit isn't working):

1. Sign up at [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org)
2. Get your free API key
3. Tell Nativeline:

```
Use the OpenWeather API instead of WeatherKit. My API key is YOUR_KEY_HERE. Use the One Call API 3.0 endpoint for current weather and forecasts.
```

<Warning>
  Never share your API key publicly. For a real app, you'd store this securely.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Weather data not loading" icon="cloud-xmark">
    - Make sure location permission is granted
    - Check that you're connected to the internet
    - Try the Simulator's Features → Location menu
    - Try asking: "Show a mock weather display with sample data to test the UI"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Location permission not appearing" icon="location-crosshairs">
    The permission popup only shows once. To reset:
    - Simulator → Device → Erase All Content and Settings
    - Or ask: "Make sure we request location permission with a usage description"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Search not finding cities" icon="magnifying-glass">
    "Use Apple's MapKit geocoding to search for cities by name"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="WeatherKit not working" icon="sun">
    WeatherKit requires iOS 16+. Make sure your Simulator is running iOS 16 or later, or switch to OpenWeather API.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Challenge: Extend Your App

Try these on your own:

1. **Widgets** — Create a home screen widget (advanced)
2. **Favorites** — Save favorite cities
3. **Notifications** — Alert when rain is expected
4. **Units toggle** — Switch between °F and °C
5. **Radar map** — Show weather radar for your area
