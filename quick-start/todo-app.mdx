# Todo App Tutorial

**⏱️ 30 minutes**

Build a complete task manager with adding, completing, and persisting tasks. You'll learn about lists, forms, state management, and local data storage.

## What You'll Build

A todo app that:
- Shows a list of tasks
- Lets you add new tasks
- Mark tasks as complete
- Delete tasks
- Saves everything locally (persists between app launches)

---

## Part 1: Create the App

### Start a New Project

On the Nativeline home page, enter this description:

```
A todo list app where I can add tasks, mark them complete with a checkbox, and delete them. Tasks should be saved so they're still there when I reopen the app.
```

### Complete the Wizard

- **Who is this for?** — Just me
- **Feel** — Simple & clean
- **Priority** — Core functionality first
- **Colors** — Choose any palette
- **Name** — Todo List

Wait for the initial build to complete.

---

## Part 2: Review What You Have

Your app should have:
- A list view (possibly empty)
- A way to add tasks
- Basic styling

Explore the Simulator. Try adding a task if the UI is ready.

<Tip>
  The initial version might not be exactly what you imagined. That's normal! We'll refine it step by step.
</Tip>

---

## Part 3: Add Task Input

If your app doesn't have a good way to add tasks, let's improve it:

```
Add a text field at the top with a placeholder "Add a new task..." and an "Add" button next to it. When I tap Add or press return, it should add the task to the list and clear the text field.
```

Test it:
1. Type a task
2. Tap Add
3. See it appear in the list

---

## Part 4: Add Checkboxes

Let's add the ability to complete tasks:

```
Add a checkbox circle to the left of each task. When I tap it, the checkbox fills in and the task text gets a strikethrough. Completed tasks should stay in the list but look different.
```

Test completing a few tasks. They should visually change to show they're done.

---

## Part 5: Add Delete Functionality

Now let's add the ability to remove tasks:

```
Add swipe-to-delete on each task. When I swipe left, show a red Delete button. Tapping it removes the task from the list.
```

Alternatively, you could ask for a delete button:

```
Add a trash icon button on the right side of each task that deletes it when tapped.
```

Test deleting a task.

---

## Part 6: Make It Persistent

Right now, tasks disappear when you close the app. Let's fix that:

```
Save all tasks locally using SwiftData so they persist between app launches. Tasks should be there when I close and reopen the app.
```

Test persistence:
1. Add a few tasks
2. Press Cmd+Shift+H to go to home screen in Simulator
3. Reopen the app
4. Your tasks should still be there!

---

## Part 7: Polish the Design

Let's make it look professional:

```
Polish the design:
- Add padding around the list
- Make task rows have a white background with rounded corners and subtle shadow
- Add a header that says "My Tasks" in large bold text
- Show a count of incomplete tasks under the header like "3 tasks remaining"
```

---

## Part 8: Add Task Details (Optional)

Want to go further? Add due dates:

```
Add optional due dates to tasks:
- Tap a task to open a detail view
- In the detail view, show a date picker to set a due date
- Display the due date under the task title in the list
- Show overdue tasks in red
```

---

## Part 9: Add Categories (Optional)

Organize tasks with categories:

```
Add categories to tasks:
- Categories: Work, Personal, Shopping, Other
- Show a small colored dot next to each task indicating its category
- Add a filter at the top to show only tasks from a specific category
```

---

## Final Result

You now have a fully functional todo app with:
- ✅ Task creation
- ✅ Completion with visual feedback
- ✅ Deletion
- ✅ Local persistence
- ✅ Polished design
- ✅ (Optional) Due dates
- ✅ (Optional) Categories

## Tips & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tasks aren't saving" icon="database">
    Make sure you asked for SwiftData or local persistence. Try:
    "Save tasks using SwiftData so they persist when the app is closed"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Swipe to delete isn't working" icon="hand-pointer">
    Some implementations might not have swipe. You can ask:
    "Use the standard iOS swipe-to-delete gesture on the list"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The design looks cramped" icon="expand">
    Ask for more spacing:
    "Add 16pt padding around the list and 12pt spacing between tasks"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I want to edit tasks" icon="pencil">
    Add editing functionality:
    "Let me tap a task to edit its title in a sheet"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Challenge: Extend Your App

Try adding these features on your own:

1. **Search** — Add a search bar to filter tasks
2. **Priority levels** — High, Medium, Low with colors
3. **Sorting** — Sort by date, priority, or alphabetically
4. **Statistics** — Show how many tasks you've completed this week
5. **Themes** — Let users choose between light and dark mode
