# Your First App

**⏱️ 10 minutes**

Let's build something! This tutorial walks you through creating your first iOS app with Nativeline. You'll go from idea to working app in the iOS Simulator in just minutes.

## What You'll Build

A simple counter app that:
- Shows a number
- Has buttons to increment and decrement
- Remembers the count

Simple, but you'll learn everything you need to build more complex apps.

---

## Step 1: Create a New App

Open Nativeline. On the Home Page, you'll see:

> **"Tell me about the app you're imagining..."**

Type your app description. For this tutorial, enter:

```
A simple counter app with a big number display and plus/minus buttons
```

Click **Create** or press Enter.

<Tip>
  In real projects, be more detailed. But for learning, simple works great!
</Tip>

## Step 2: Complete the Wizard

Nativeline's wizard helps customize your app with a few quick questions:

### What feel do you want?
Choose **Simple & clean** — minimalist works well for a counter.

### Similar apps?
You can skip this or type "like Apple's calculator" for inspiration.

### Pick colors
Choose any palette you like, or let the AI generate one.

### Name your app
Enter: **Counter**

Click **Create App** to continue.

---

## Step 3: Watch It Build

Nativeline now creates your app:

1. **Setting up the project** — Creating the Xcode structure
2. **Writing the code** — Generating Swift/SwiftUI
3. **Building** — Compiling everything

This takes 30-60 seconds. You'll see a progress animation.

<Note>
  First build takes longer because Xcode needs to compile the entire project. Future builds are much faster.
</Note>

## Step 4: Explore Your Workspace

Once complete, you'll see the main workspace:

### Left Side: Chat Interface
- **Your messages** — What you ask for
- **AI responses** — What the AI is doing
- **Tool cards** — Files being created/edited
- **Todo list** — Current tasks

### Right Side: iOS Simulator
Your app running on a virtual iPhone. You can interact with it just like a real phone.

Try tapping the buttons in your counter app!

---

## Step 5: Make Your First Change

Let's customize the app. In the chat, type:

```
Make the number display larger and use a bold font
```

Watch the AI:
1. **Plan** the change
2. **Edit** the code
3. **Rebuild** the app
4. **Show** the result

Your counter now has a bigger number!

---

## Step 6: Add a Feature

Let's add something new. Type:

```
Add a reset button that sets the count back to zero
```

The AI will:
1. Create the button
2. Add the reset logic
3. Position it appropriately

Test it — tap reset and watch the count go to zero.

---

## Step 7: Polish the Design

Let's make it look better. Type:

```
Style the buttons with rounded corners, a blue background, and white text. Add some spacing between them.
```

Now you have a polished counter app!

- ✅ Used the wizard to customize settings
- ✅ Made changes through natural language
- ✅ Added new features without coding
- ✅ Styled your app visually

You've got the basics down. Now let's build something more substantial.

## Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="The Simulator isn't showing" icon="mobile">
    - Check if it's behind other windows
    - Look in other Spaces/Desktops (swipe on trackpad)
    - It may take 30-60 seconds to boot the first time
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Build failed" icon="circle-xmark">
    Don't worry! Nativeline automatically:
    1. Detects the error
    2. Proposes a fix
    3. Rebuilds

    If it keeps failing, describe the issue in your own words.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="App doesn't match what I asked for" icon="circle-question">
    Be more specific in your next prompt:
    - Instead of "make it bigger" → "make the font size 48pt"
    - Instead of "change the color" → "change to blue (#007AFF)"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
