# Notes App Tutorial

**⏱️ 45 minutes**

Build a notes app with user accounts and cloud synchronization. You'll learn about authentication, cloud databases, and real-time sync using Supabase.

## What You'll Build

A notes app that:
- Has user sign up and login
- Creates, edits, and deletes notes
- Syncs notes to the cloud
- Works across devices (same account = same notes)

---

## Before You Start

This tutorial requires a Supabase account (free tier available).

### Set Up Supabase

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a free account
2. Create a new project (any name, choose a region near you)
3. Wait for the project to initialize (~2 minutes)
4. Note your project URL and anon key (Settings → API)

<Tip>
  Keep the Supabase dashboard open — you'll need it throughout this tutorial.
</Tip>

---

## Part 1: Create the App

On the Nativeline home page, enter:

```
A notes app with user authentication. Users can sign up with email/password, log in, and create personal notes. Notes sync to Supabase cloud database so they're available on any device.
```

### Complete the Wizard

- **Who is this for?** — Anyone (public app)
- **Feel** — Simple & clean
- **Priority** — Core functionality first
- **Colors** — Your choice
- **Name** — Cloud Notes

---

## Part 2: Connect Supabase

Tell Nativeline about your Supabase project:

```
Connect to my Supabase project:
- URL: YOUR_SUPABASE_URL
- Anon Key: YOUR_ANON_KEY

Set up authentication with email/password sign up and login.
```

Replace `YOUR_SUPABASE_URL` and `YOUR_ANON_KEY` with your actual values from the Supabase dashboard.

<Warning>
  The anon key is safe to include in apps — it only allows operations that your Row Level Security policies permit. Never share your service_role key.
</Warning>

---

## Part 3: Create the Notes Table

We need a database table to store notes. In your Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to **Table Editor**
2. Click **Create a new table**
3. Name: `notes`
4. Add columns:
   - `id` (uuid, primary key) — auto-generated
   - `user_id` (uuid, not null) — links to auth.users
   - `title` (text)
   - `content` (text)
   - `created_at` (timestamptz, default: now())
   - `updated_at` (timestamptz, default: now())

5. Enable Row Level Security (RLS)

### Add RLS Policies

In the Supabase dashboard, go to Authentication → Policies and add:

**Select policy (users can read their own notes):**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own notes" ON notes
FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

**Insert policy (users can create notes):**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can create own notes" ON notes
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

**Update policy (users can edit their own notes):**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own notes" ON notes
FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

**Delete policy (users can delete their own notes):**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own notes" ON notes
FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

Now tell Nativeline:

```
I've created a 'notes' table in Supabase with columns: id (uuid), user_id (uuid), title (text), content (text), created_at, updated_at. I've enabled RLS so users can only access their own notes.
```

## Part 4: Build the Auth Flow

Let's create the login and signup screens:

```
Create authentication screens:
- A welcome screen with "Sign Up" and "Log In" buttons
- Sign up form with email, password, and confirm password
- Log in form with email and password
- Show loading state during authentication
- Handle errors with user-friendly messages
```

Test the flow:
1. Try signing up with an email
2. You should be logged in and see the notes list
3. Log out and try logging back in

---

## Part 5: Build the Notes List

Create the main notes interface:

```
After login, show a list of the user's notes:
- Each note shows title and preview of content
- Tap a note to open and edit it
- Floating "+" button to create new note
- Pull to refresh to sync with cloud
- Show "No notes yet" when empty
```

---

## Part 6: Create Note Editor

Build the editing experience:

```
Create a note editor screen:
- Large title field at top
- Text area for note content below
- Auto-save as the user types (debounced)
- Show "Saving..." indicator when syncing
- Back button to return to list
```

---

## Part 7: Add Note Deletion

Let users delete notes:

```
Add swipe-to-delete on notes in the list. Show a confirmation alert before deleting. Delete from both local state and Supabase.
```

---

## Part 8: Add Real-time Sync

Make notes update in real-time:

```
Subscribe to Supabase real-time updates for the notes table. When notes are added, updated, or deleted on another device, reflect those changes immediately in the app.
```

Test this by:
1. Opening your Supabase dashboard → Table Editor → notes
2. Editing a note directly in Supabase
3. Watching it update in the app

---

## Part 9: Add Search

Help users find notes:

```
Add a search bar at the top of the notes list. Filter notes by title and content as the user types. Show "No results" when nothing matches.
```

---

## Part 10: Polish the Design

Make it look professional:

```
Polish the notes app:
- Notes list items have a subtle shadow and rounded corners
- Title uses a bold, larger font
- Show relative timestamps ("2 hours ago", "Yesterday")
- Add a profile button that shows email and logout option
- Use a consistent color scheme throughout
```

---

## Final Result

You now have a cloud-synced notes app with:
- ✅ User registration and login
- ✅ Create, read, update, delete notes
- ✅ Cloud sync via Supabase
- ✅ Real-time updates
- ✅ Search functionality
- ✅ Polished UI

|---------|-----------------|
| **Authentication** | Email/password signup and login |
| **Database** | Supabase tables and queries |
| **Row Level Security** | Protecting user data |
| **Real-time** | Live sync between devices |
| **CRUD Operations** | Create, read, update, delete |

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can't connect to Supabase" icon="plug">
    - Double-check your project URL (ends in .supabase.co)
    - Make sure you're using the anon key, not the service_role key
    - Check if your Supabase project is still initializing
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sign up not working" icon="user-plus">
    - Check Supabase Authentication → Users to see if user was created
    - Check if email confirmation is required (Authentication → Settings)
    - For testing, you can disable email confirmation
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Notes not saving" icon="database">
    - Check Supabase Table Editor for errors
    - Verify RLS policies are set correctly
    - Make sure user_id is being set when creating notes
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Real-time not updating" icon="bolt">
    - Real-time requires Supabase Realtime to be enabled (it's on by default)
    - Check the browser console in Supabase for errors
    - Try refreshing the app
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Permission denied errors" icon="lock">
    Your RLS policies might be incorrect. In Supabase:
    1. Go to Authentication → Policies
    2. Verify each policy uses `auth.uid() = user_id`
    3. Make sure RLS is enabled on the table
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Challenge: Extend Your App

Try these on your own:

1. **Rich text** — Add formatting (bold, italic, lists)
2. **Folders** — Organize notes into folders
3. **Sharing** — Share notes with other users
4. **Markdown** — Support markdown preview
5. **Offline mode** — Work offline and sync when back online
6. **Attachments** — Add images to notes using Supabase Storage
