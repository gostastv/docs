# Chat Interface

The chat interface is where you spend most of your time in Nativeline. It's your command center for building, testing, and refining your iOS app.

## Workspace Overview

When you open a project, you'll see the main workspace:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Toolbar (project name, bits, settings, account)                │
├────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                │                                                │
│   Sidebar      │              Main Area                         │
│                │                                                │
│   - Chat       │   ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐     │
│   - Settings   │   │  Conversation History                │     │
│   - Database   │   │                                      │     │
│   - Deploy     │   │  Your messages → (right)             │     │
│                │   │  ← AI responses (left)               │     │
│                │   │  Tool cards, todo lists              │     │
│                │   │                                      │     │
│                │   └──────────────────────────────────────┘     │
│                │                                                │
│                │   ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐     │
│                │   │  Message Input                       │     │
│                │   └──────────────────────────────────────┘     │
└────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## Sidebar Tabs

### Chat Tab
Your primary workspace. Communicate with the AI to build your app.

### Settings Tab
Configure your app's identity, permissions, and capabilities. See [Project Settings](/features/project-settings).

### Database Tab
View and manage your Supabase database tables (if connected). See [Supabase](/integrations/supabase/overview).

### Deploy Tab
Publish your app to TestFlight for beta testing. See [Publishing](/publishing/overview).

## The Conversation Area

### Your Messages (Right Side)

When you send a message, it appears on the right:
- Your text
- Any attached images
- Timestamp

### AI Responses (Left Side)

The AI's responses include:

**Text Explanations**
The AI explains what it's doing, answers questions, or asks for clarification.

**Tool Cards**
When the AI creates or edits files:
```
📝 Edit File
ContentView.swift
Added login button with blue background
```

**Todo Lists**
For complex requests, a checklist shows:
- Steps to complete (⏳)
- Current task (🔄)
- Completed items (✅)

**Build Status**
Indicators showing:
- Building... (compiling)
- Success (app running)
- Error (build failed)

---

## Sending Messages

### Basic Input

Type your message and:
- **Enter** — Send message
- **Shift+Enter** — New line
- **Cmd+Enter** — Quick send

### Attaching Images

Drag and drop images into the chat:
- Up to **5 images** per message
- Formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, HEIC

See [Using Images](/features/using-images) for best practices.

---

## Message Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Be specific.** Instead of "make it better," try "increase the button height to 50pt and add a subtle shadow."
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **One thing at a time.** Ask for one feature or change per message for best results.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Reference what exists.** Say "change the blue header" instead of "change the header" so the AI knows exactly what you mean.
</Tip>

---

## Understanding AI Responses

### When Things Work

You'll see:
1. Todo list with items being checked off
2. Tool cards showing files being created/edited
3. App rebuilding in the Simulator
4. Success message when complete

### When Errors Occur

Build failures are handled automatically:
1. AI detects the error
2. Shows what went wrong
3. Proposes a fix
4. Applies fix and rebuilds

Don't panic — errors are normal. See [Debugging Guide](/guides/debugging) for details.

### When AI Needs Clarification

The AI may ask questions:
- "Did you mean the header at the top or the section title?"
- "What color for the button?"
- "Should this save locally or to the cloud?"

Answer naturally to continue.

---

## The Simulator Preview

The iOS Simulator shows your app running live:

- **Instant feedback** — See changes as builds complete
- **Real interaction** — Tap, scroll, use your app
- **Error visibility** — Spot crashes and UI issues

Watch the build status:
- **Building...** — App compiling
- **Success** — App running
- **Error** — Build failed

---

## Conversation Management

### Scrolling History

Your conversation is saved. Scroll up to see:
- Previous requests
- What the AI built
- Earlier iterations

### Clearing the Plan

To start fresh with a new approach:
```
/planclear
```

This clears the current plan but preserves your code.

### Starting Fresh Conversation

If the conversation gets too long:
1. Clear conversation option in menu
2. Confirm
3. Your code is preserved — only chat history clears

<Note>
  Clearing conversation doesn't delete your app. Only the chat history is cleared.
</Note>

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| Send message | Enter |
| New line | Shift+Enter |
| Quick send | Cmd+Enter |
| Stop AI | Escape |

See [Keyboard Shortcuts](/features/keyboard-shortcuts) for the complete list.

---

## The Code Preview

When the AI writes code, you can watch in real-time. This helps you:
- Understand what's being created
- Catch issues early
- Learn Swift by watching

---

## Tips for Effective Building

### Start Simple

Begin with core functionality. Add polish later.

### Test Frequently

Check after each change. Catching issues early saves time.

### Use Images

Visual references reduce iterations. See [Using Images](/features/using-images).

### Give Feedback

If something isn't right, tell the AI:
- "That's not what I meant..."
- "Make it more..."
- "Change the color to..."
