# Chat Interface

The chat interface is where you spend most of your time in Nativeline. It's your command center for building, testing, and refining your iOS app.

## Workspace Overview

When you open a project, you'll see the main workspace:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Toolbar (project name, bits, ✈️ deploy, settings, account)    │
├────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                │                                                │
│   Tabs         │              Main Area                         │
│                │                                                │
│   - Build      │   ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐     │

## Main Tabs

### Build Tab
Your primary workspace. This is where you chat with the AI to build your app. The AI responds with explanations, creates files, and builds your app automatically.

### Database Tab
View and manage your Supabase database tables (appears when Supabase is connected). See [Supabase](/integrations/supabase/overview).

### Code Tab
View and edit your app's Swift code directly. This is a **Pro feature** — free users will see an upgrade prompt. See [Code Editor](/features/code-editor).

### Project Settings Tab
Configure your app's identity, permissions, capabilities, and appearance. See [Project Settings](/features/project-settings).

### Deploy Button (Toolbar)
The **plane icon** (✈️) in the top-right toolbar lets you publish to TestFlight for beta testing. See [Publishing](/publishing/overview).

---

## The Conversation Area

### Your Messages (Right Side)

When you send a message, it appears on the right:
- Your text
- Any attached images
- Timestamp

### AI Responses (Left Side)

The AI's responses include:

**Text Explanations**
The AI explains what it's doing, answers questions, or asks for clarification.

**Thinking Sections**
For complex requests, you may see collapsible thinking sections that show the AI's reasoning process. Click to expand/collapse.

**Code Previews**
When the AI writes or edits code, you'll see a live streaming preview of the code being written. This shows:
- The file being edited
- The code changes in real-time
- Status (Writing, Wrote, Editing, Edited)

**Tool Cards**
Actions the AI takes appear as cards showing:
- File operations (creating, reading, editing files)
- Build commands
- Other tool executions

**Build Status**
Indicators showing:
- Building... (compiling)
- Success (app running in Simulator)
- Error (build failed — AI will attempt to fix)

---

## Sending Messages

### Basic Input

Type your message and:
- **Enter** — Send message
- **Shift+Enter** — New line
- **Cmd+Enter** — Quick send

### Attaching Images

Drag and drop images into the chat:
- Up to **5 images** per message
- Formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, HEIC

See [Using Images](/features/using-images) for best practices.

---

## Message Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Be specific.** Instead of "make it better," try "increase the button height to 50pt and add a subtle shadow."
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **One thing at a time.** Ask for one feature or change per message for best results.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Reference what exists.** Say "change the blue header" instead of "change the header" so the AI knows exactly what you mean.
</Tip>

---

## Understanding AI Responses

### When Things Work

You'll see:
1. Code previews showing files being created/edited in real-time
2. Tool cards indicating what actions are being taken
3. App automatically building and launching in the Simulator
4. Success when the build completes

### When Errors Occur

Build failures are handled automatically:
1. AI detects the error
2. Shows what went wrong
3. Proposes a fix
4. Applies fix and rebuilds

Don't panic — errors are normal. See [Debugging Guide](/guides/debugging) for details.

### When AI Needs Clarification

The AI may ask questions:
- "Did you mean the header at the top or the section title?"
- "What color for the button?"
- "Should this save locally or to the cloud?"

Answer naturally to continue.

## The Simulator Preview

The iOS Simulator shows your app running live:

- **Instant feedback** — See changes as builds complete
- **Real interaction** — Tap, scroll, use your app
- **Error visibility** — Spot crashes and UI issues

Watch the build status:
- **Building...** — App compiling
- **Success** — App running
- **Error** — Build failed

---

## Conversation Management

### Scrolling History

Your conversation is saved. Scroll up to see:
- Previous requests
- What the AI built
- Earlier iterations

### Slash Commands

Nativeline supports several slash commands for power users:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/help` | Shows all available commands |
| `/plan` | Shows current plan status and progress |
| `/planclear` | Clears the current plan (keeps your code) |
| `/debug` | Toggles debug logging on/off |

<Tip>
  `/planclear` is useful when the AI seems stuck or you want to start a new approach. It clears the internal plan but preserves all your code.
</Tip>

### Starting Fresh Conversation

If the conversation gets too long:
1. Clear conversation option in menu
2. Confirm
3. Your code is preserved — only chat history clears

<Note>
  Clearing conversation doesn't delete your app. Only the chat history is cleared.
</Note>

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| Send message | Enter |
| New line | Shift+Enter |
| Quick send | Cmd+Enter |
| Stop AI | Escape |

See [Keyboard Shortcuts](/features/keyboard-shortcuts) for the complete list.

## The Code Preview

When the AI writes code, you can watch in real-time. This helps you:
- Understand what's being created
- Catch issues early
- Learn Swift by watching

---

## Tips for Effective Building

### Start Simple

Begin with core functionality. Add polish later.

### Test Frequently

Check after each change. Catching issues early saves time.

### Use Images

Visual references reduce iterations. See [Using Images](/features/using-images).

### Give Feedback

If something isn't right, tell the AI:
- "That's not what I meant..."
- "Make it more..."
- "Change the color to..."
