# Publishing to TestFlight

TestFlight is Apple's official platform for beta testing iOS apps. Once you're happy with your app, you can share it with up to 10,000 testers before publishing to the App Store.

## What is TestFlight?

TestFlight lets you:
- **Distribute your app** to testers without the App Store
- **Get feedback** from real users on real devices
- **Test on actual iPhones** (not just the Simulator)
- **Iterate quickly** with multiple builds

<Note>
  TestFlight is the last step before the App Store. Most successful apps go through multiple rounds of TestFlight testing.
</Note>

## Requirements

Before you can publish to TestFlight, you need:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Apple Developer Account" icon="apple">
    $99/year from [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Completed App" icon="check">
    Your app builds successfully in the Simulator
  </Card>
  <Card title="App Store Connect Setup" icon="gear">
    Included with your Developer account
  </Card>
  <Card title="App Icon" icon="image">
    Required for App Store Connect
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## First-Time Setup

You'll need to configure credentials so Nativeline can upload to Apple.

### Option A: App Store Connect API Key (Recommended)

This is the most reliable method. The API key is a file you download from Apple.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open App Store Connect">
    Go to [appstoreconnect.apple.com](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Keys">
    Click **Users and Access** → **Keys** tab → **App Store Connect API**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new key">
    Click the **+** button to create a new key:
    - **Name:** "Nativeline"
    - **Access:** Admin (required for uploading)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Download the .p8 file">
    Click **Download** next to your new key.

    ⚠️ **You can only download this once!** Save it somewhere safe.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy your Issuer ID">
    Find **Issuer ID** at the top of the Keys page. Copy it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get your Team ID">
    Go to [developer.apple.com/account](https://developer.apple.com/account) and find your **Team ID** in the Membership section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure in Nativeline">
    In Nativeline, go to **Deploy** tab:
    1. Drag and drop your `.p8` file
    2. Enter your Issuer ID
    3. Enter your Team ID
    4. Click **Validate**
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Keep your `.p8` file secret! Anyone with this file can upload apps to your account.
</Warning>

### Option B: Xcode Account

If you're already signed into Xcode with your Apple ID:

1. Go to the **Deploy** tab
2. Select **Use Xcode Account**
3. Nativeline uses your existing credentials

<Note>
  This method may require re-authentication periodically.
</Note>

## Deploying Your App

Once configured, deploying is straightforward:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start the upload">
    Click the **plane icon** (✈️) in the top-right toolbar
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm deployment">
    Start the deployment process
  </Step>
  <Step title="Watch the progress">
    You'll see each stage complete:
    - Setting up certificates
    - Building your app
    - Creating archive
    - Uploading to Apple
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for success">
    The upload typically takes 5-15 minutes
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The Deployment Process

Here's what happens behind the scenes:

### 1. Code Signing

Nativeline sets up the certificates and provisioning profiles needed to sign your app. This proves the app is from you.

### 2. Building

Your app is compiled in release mode - optimized and ready for distribution.

### 3. Archiving

The compiled app is packaged into an archive format that Apple accepts.

### 4. Uploading

The archive is uploaded to App Store Connect via Apple's official tools.

### 5. Apple Processing

After upload, Apple processes your build:
- Validating the app format
- Running automated tests
- Checking for issues

This takes 10-30 minutes.

## After Upload

Once Apple processes your build:

### Check Processing Status

1. Open [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)
2. Find your app
3. Go to the **TestFlight** tab
4. Watch the status change from "Processing" to "Ready to Test"

### Add Testers

**Internal Testers (up to 100):**
- Your team members
- Added via App Store Connect
- Get instant access to new builds

**External Testers (up to 10,000):**
- Public beta testers
- Requires brief review from Apple (usually <24 hours)
- Can share via public link

### Invite Process

1. Go to **TestFlight** in App Store Connect
2. Click **+** next to Internal Testers or External Testers
3. Add email addresses or create a public link
4. Testers receive an email invitation
5. They install TestFlight from the App Store
6. They redeem the invitation to install your app

## Updating Your TestFlight Build

To release a new version:

1. Make changes in Nativeline
2. Update the version number (Settings → Version)
3. Deploy again
4. Testers are notified of the update

<Tip>
  Increment the version number for each new build. Apple requires each build to have a unique version.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting TestFlight

<AccordionGroup>

## Tips for Successful TestFlight

<Check>
  **Do:**
  - Test thoroughly in Simulator before uploading
  - Increment version numbers for each build

## What's Next?

After successful TestFlight testing, you're ready for the App Store! This final step happens in App Store Connect:
