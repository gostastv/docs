# Using Images

A picture is worth a thousand words — and tokens. Visual references help the AI understand exactly what you want, reducing iterations and getting better results faster.

## Why Use Images?

### Without Images

```
Create a card with the title at the top, then an image below it,
then some description text, then a price on the right side,
and a favorite button that's a heart icon in the corner...
```

→ Multiple iterations to get it right

### With Images

```
Make my cards look like this [attached screenshot]
```

→ AI sees exactly what you want, often gets it first try

## What to Attach

### Screenshots from Other Apps

Find an app with a UI element you like:
1. Screenshot it
2. Drag into Nativeline chat
3. "Make my [element] look like this"

### Design Mockups

Create mockups in:
- **Figma** — Professional design tool
- **Sketch** — Mac design app
- **Canva** — Easy online design
- **Paper sketches** — Take a photo

### Reference Images

Any image that shows what you want:
- UI patterns from websites
- Style guides
- Color palettes
- Icon examples

### Sketches and Wireframes

Hand-drawn sketches work great:
1. Sketch your layout on paper
2. Take a photo
3. "Implement this layout"

---

## How to Attach Images

### Drag and Drop

1. Find the image file
2. Drag it onto the Nativeline chat
3. It attaches to your message

### Copy and Paste

1. Copy an image (Cmd+C)
2. Paste in the chat (Cmd+V)

### Screenshot Directly

1. Take a screenshot (Cmd+Shift+4)
2. Drag the saved file to chat
3. Or copy and paste directly

## Image Guidelines

### Supported Formats

- PNG
- JPG / JPEG
- GIF
- WebP
- HEIC

### Size Limits

- Up to **5 images** per message
- Images are automatically optimized

### Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Crop to the relevant area.** Don't show your entire screen — focus on the specific element.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Highlight what matters.** Use annotations or arrows to point out specific details.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Show context when needed.** If the element's position matters, include surrounding areas.
</Tip>

## Effective Image Prompts

### Be Specific About What to Copy

**Vague:**
```
Make it look like this [image]
```

**Specific:**
```
Copy the card layout from this image:
- Same spacing and proportions
- Similar shadow style
- Keep the price position

But use my app's blue color scheme instead of their green.
```

### Reference Multiple Images

```
For the navigation, use this style [image 1]
For the cards, use this layout [image 2]
For the colors, follow this palette [image 3]
```

### Describe Differences

```
Make it look like this screenshot, but:
- Use rounded corners instead of square
- Add more padding
- Remove the subtitle
```

---

## Common Use Cases

### Copying a Layout

```
Implement this layout exactly [screenshot]
```

### Matching a Style

```
Use this visual style for my entire app [style reference]
- Same button shapes
- Similar spacing
- This shadow intensity
```

### Fixing a Visual Bug

```
This is what I'm seeing [screenshot of bug]
I expected it to look like this [mockup of correct version]
```

### Showing Desired Interaction

```
When the user swipes, I want this animation [GIF/video]
```

### Showing Current State + Desired State

```
Here's how it currently looks [current screenshot]
Here's how I want it to look [mockup]
```

## Screenshots from Simulator

Take screenshots of your own app to reference:

### How to Screenshot Simulator

1. Click on the Simulator
2. Press **Cmd+S** to save screenshot
3. Or **Cmd+Shift+4** to select area

### Why Screenshot Your Own App

- "Keep the header exactly like this, but change the body"
- "This part works — make the other screens match"
- "The spacing is perfect here — use this throughout"

---

## Annotating Images

### Simple Annotations

Use Preview (Mac) or any image editor:
- **Circles** — Highlight specific elements
- **Arrows** — Point to details
- **Text** — Add labels or notes
- **Boxes** — Outline areas of interest

### When to Annotate

- Multiple elements in one screenshot
- Subtle details that might be missed
- Showing what to change vs. keep

---

## Multiple Images in One Message

You can attach up to 5 images per message:

```
Here's the header style I want [image 1]
Here's the card style [image 2]
Here's the color palette [image 3]

Create a dashboard with:
- Header using style from image 1
- Data displayed as cards like image 2
- Colors from image 3
```

---

## What Images Can't Do

### Not for Long Text

Don't use images of text. Type text directly — it's easier for the AI to process.

### Not for Code

If you want to show code, paste it as text rather than a screenshot.

### Not for Everything

Sometimes words are clearer:
- "Make the button 50pt tall" is clearer than an image
- "Change the color to #007AFF" is more precise

Use images for **visual design**, use words for **specific values**.

## Example Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find inspiration">
    Screenshot a UI you like from another app or website.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Attach to chat">
    Drag the image into Nativeline.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Describe what you want">
    "Create a profile card like this image, but with our app's colors"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and refine">
    If something's off: "The spacing should be tighter, like this [annotated image]"
  </Step>
</Steps>

    - Ensure file isn't corrupted
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="AI not understanding the image" icon="circle-question">
    - Crop to show only relevant parts
    - Add text description alongside the image
    - Annotate to highlight specific elements
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Result doesn't match image" icon="not-equal">
    - Be more specific about what to copy
