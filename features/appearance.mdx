# Appearance

Appearance settings control how your app looks in different system modes — light mode, dark mode, or following the user's system preference.

## Accessing Appearance Settings

1. Open your project
2. Go to **Settings** → **Appearance**

---

## Appearance Modes

### Light Mode

Your app always uses light colors regardless of system setting.

- Light backgrounds
- Dark text
- Consistent across all devices

### Dark Mode

Your app always uses dark colors regardless of system setting.

- Dark backgrounds
- Light text
- Good for media apps, reading apps

### System (Automatic)

Your app follows the user's iOS setting.

- Switches when user changes system mode
- Most users expect this behavior
- **Recommended for most apps**

---

## Setting Appearance Mode

### In Nativeline

1. Settings → Appearance
2. Select: Light, Dark, or System
3. Save

### Via Chat

```
Make the app follow the system appearance setting
```

or

```
Force the app to always use dark mode
```

---

## Designing for Both Modes

If you use System mode, your app needs to look good in both light and dark.

### System Colors

Use iOS system colors that adapt automatically:

| Color | Light Mode | Dark Mode |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| `.background` | White | Black |
| `.secondaryBackground` | Light gray | Dark gray |
| `.label` | Black | White |
| `.secondaryLabel` | Gray | Light gray |
| `.accent` | Your accent color | Same |

### Ask the AI

```
Make sure all colors in the app adapt properly to dark mode.
Use system colors where possible.
```

### Checking Both Modes

In the Simulator:
1. Open Settings app
2. Display & Brightness
3. Switch between Light and Dark
4. See your app update

Or: Features → Toggle Appearance (in Simulator menu)

---

## Accent Color

Your app's primary color used for:
- Buttons
- Links
- Selection highlights
- Tint color throughout

### Setting Accent Color

1. Settings → Appearance → Accent Color
2. Choose color or enter hex value
3. Save

### Via Chat

```
Use #007AFF (blue) as the app's accent color
```

---

## Status Bar

The status bar shows time, battery, signal. You can control its style:

### Light Content

White text/icons — use with dark backgrounds

### Dark Content

Black text/icons — use with light backgrounds

### Default

Follows the appearance mode

### Setting Status Bar Style

```
Use light status bar content throughout the app
```

---

## Designing Dark Mode

### Do

- ✅ Use pure black sparingly (can cause smearing on OLED)
- ✅ Use dark grays (#1C1C1E, #2C2C2E) for surfaces
- ✅ Reduce contrast for comfortable viewing
- ✅ Test in dark mode regularly

### Don't

- ❌ Use light colors that don't adapt
- ❌ Forget about images (they may need variants)
- ❌ Ignore elevation (cards should be slightly lighter)
- ❌ Use pure white text (too harsh)

---

## Images in Dark Mode

Some images need different versions:

### Problem Images

- Logos with light backgrounds
- Icons that assume light mode
- Screenshots of light UI

### Solutions

**Option 1: Transparent backgrounds**
```
Make all icons use transparent backgrounds so they work on any color
```

**Option 2: Provide both versions**
```
Add dark mode variants of the logo and important images
```

**Option 3: Color inversion**
For simple graphics, you can invert colors in dark mode.

---

## Testing Appearance

### Quick Toggle

In Simulator: Features → Toggle Appearance

### Sustained Testing

Live with your app in dark mode for a while. Issues become obvious through regular use.

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Text invisible | Use system colors |
| Images look wrong | Add dark mode variants |
| Too bright in dark mode | Reduce whites, use dark grays |
| Too dim in light mode | Ensure sufficient contrast |

## Appearance Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use System colors" icon="palette">
    SwiftUI's semantic colors (`.background`, `.label`, etc.) adapt automatically. Use them instead of hard-coded colors.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test both modes equally" icon="circle-half-stroke">
    Don't build in light mode and "check" dark mode later. Alternate regularly during development.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Consider your audience" icon="users">
    Some apps are better in fixed mode:
    - Reading apps → User preference
    - Photo apps → Dark mode (better for viewing)
    - Business apps → Often light mode
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Elevation matters in dark mode" icon="layer-group">
    In dark mode, "higher" surfaces should be slightly lighter. Cards on a background should be visible through subtle brightness differences, not borders.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
