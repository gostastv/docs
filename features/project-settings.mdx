# Project Settings

Project Settings is where you define what your app is and what it can do. Access it from the **Settings** tab in your project sidebar.

## App Identity

### App Name

The name displayed under your app icon on the home screen. This is what users see when they install your app.

<Tip>
  Keep it short (under 12 characters works best) so it doesn't get truncated on the home screen.
</Tip>

**To change your app name:**
1. Go to **Settings → App Identity**
2. Click on the name field
3. Type your new name
4. Changes are saved automatically

### App Icon

Your app's visual identity. This appears on the home screen, in settings, and throughout iOS.

**Requirements:**
- **Size:** 1024x1024 pixels (recommended)
- **Format:** PNG, JPG, or HEIC
- **Shape:** Square (iOS automatically rounds the corners)

**To set your app icon:**
1. Go to **Settings → App Icon**
2. Click the icon area or drag and drop an image
3. Select your image file
4. The icon is applied automatically

<Note>
  iOS creates multiple sizes from your 1024x1024 image. Use a simple, recognizable design that looks good even at small sizes.
</Note>

### Version Number

Your app's version, shown in the App Store and Settings app. Use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/):
- **Major.Minor.Patch** (e.g., 1.0.0)
- Increment **Major** for big changes
- Increment **Minor** for new features
- Increment **Patch** for bug fixes

**To update your version:**
1. Go to **Settings → Version**
2. Enter your new version number
3. Changes are saved automatically

### Bundle Identifier

A unique identifier for your app (e.g., `com.yourname.appname`). This is set during project creation but can be changed.

<Warning>
  Changing the bundle identifier creates a "new" app from Apple's perspective. Don't change this after publishing unless necessary.
</Warning>

## Permissions

When your app needs access to device features, you must declare permissions and explain why. Users see these explanations when prompted.

<Warning>
  **Bad descriptions:**
  - "We need camera access" (no explanation of why)

</Warning>

  **Good descriptions:**
  - "This app uses your camera to scan barcodes for quick item lookup"
  - "Your location helps us show nearby coffee shops and estimated travel time"
  - "Enable notifications to receive reminders for your scheduled habits"
</Check>
