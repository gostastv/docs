# AI Memory

Nativeline's AI remembers your project — what you've built, your preferences, and the patterns you use. This memory makes the AI smarter and more helpful over time.

## What the AI Remembers

### Project Structure

The AI knows:
- What files exist in your project
- How your app is organized
- What screens and features you have
- The relationships between components

### Conversation History

The AI remembers:
- What you've asked for
- Previous design decisions
- Problems you've encountered
- Solutions that worked

### Code Patterns

The AI learns:
- Your preferred coding style
- Design patterns you use
- Naming conventions
- How you structure features

### Design Preferences

The AI notices:
- Colors you like
- Spacing patterns
- Typography choices
- Layout preferences

## How Memory Helps

### Consistency

The AI maintains consistent style across your app:

```
"Add a settings screen"
```

Without memory: Generic settings screen
With memory: Settings screen matching your app's existing style

### Context

The AI understands references to existing features:

```
"Make the profile screen work like the settings screen"
```

The AI knows what both screens look like and can match the pattern.

### Continuity

Come back tomorrow, and the AI remembers where you left off:

```
"Continue with the checkout feature"
```

The AI recalls the checkout context and picks up where it stopped.

## The .nativeline Folder

Your project contains a hidden `.nativeline` folder that stores:

```
.nativeline/
├── memory.json      # Project context and patterns
├── conversation/    # Chat history
└── plans/           # Active and completed plans
```

<Warning>
  Don't delete the `.nativeline` folder unless you want to reset the AI's memory. Your code will remain, but the AI will need to re-learn your project.
</Warning>

---

## Building Memory Effectively

### Be Consistent

Using consistent terminology helps the AI learn:

- Always call it "the header" (not sometimes "top bar")
- Use the same names for concepts
- Reference features by their names

### Correct Early

If the AI gets something wrong, correct it:

```
"That's not quite right. In this app, cards should always
have 16pt padding and rounded corners."
```

The AI remembers these corrections.

### Establish Patterns

Set patterns explicitly:

```
"For all forms in this app, use:
- 16pt spacing between fields
- Blue submit buttons
- Error messages below the field in red"
```

Future forms will follow these patterns automatically.

## Memory and Plans

Plans are part of AI memory. When you:

- Start a plan: AI remembers the goal and progress
- Continue a plan: AI picks up from last completed step
- Clear a plan (`/planclear`): Plan cleared, but project memory remains

### Resuming Work

```
"Continue where we left off"
```

The AI checks:
1. Is there an active plan? Continue that.
2. What was being built? Resume that context.
3. What patterns have been established? Apply them.

---

## When Memory Causes Issues

### Stuck Patterns

Sometimes the AI keeps trying the same approach:

**Solution:** Be explicit about wanting something different:
```
"Try a completely different approach this time.
Don't use the pattern from before."
```

### Wrong Assumptions

If the AI assumes something incorrect:

**Solution:** Correct it directly:
```
"Actually, I want the buttons to be different on this screen.
Don't follow the previous pattern here."
```

### Conflicting Information

If you've given contradictory instructions over time:

**Solution:** Clarify the current state:
```
"To be clear: all buttons in the app should now be blue.
Ignore any previous instructions about button colors."
```

---

## Resetting Memory

### Clearing the Plan

To start fresh with a new approach:
```
/planclear
```

This clears the current plan but keeps project memory.

### Clearing Conversation

Clear the conversation history in settings. This:
- Removes chat history
- Keeps your code
- AI re-learns from existing code

### Full Reset (Advanced)

To completely reset AI memory:
1. Close Nativeline
2. Delete the `.nativeline` folder in your project
3. Reopen the project

The AI will analyze your code fresh and build new memory.

## Memory Across Sessions

### What Persists

- Project structure knowledge
- Conversation history
- Active plans
- Learned patterns

### What's Recalculated

Each session, the AI:
- Re-reads your current code
- Updates its understanding
- Incorporates any manual changes

This means manual code changes (via Code Editor or Xcode) are automatically incorporated.

---

## Privacy and Data

### Local Storage

Memory is stored locally on your Mac:
- In your project's `.nativeline` folder
- Not uploaded to cloud
- Deleted when you delete the project

### What's Sent to AI

When you send a message:
- Your current message
- Relevant context from memory
- Current code being modified

Code is processed by the AI but not stored on Anthropic's servers.
