# iOS Simulator

The iOS Simulator lets you test your app on a virtual iPhone or iPad on your Mac. It's your primary tool for seeing your app in action.

## What is the Simulator?

The Simulator is a virtual iOS device running on your Mac. It:

- Runs your actual compiled app
- Simulates iPhone/iPad hardware
- Supports most iOS features
- Updates instantly as you build

---

## How It Works with Nativeline

1. You make changes via chat
2. Nativeline rebuilds your app
3. App automatically launches in Simulator
4. You test and iterate

The Simulator appears alongside your Nativeline workspace, giving you instant feedback.

## Interacting with the Simulator

### Basic Interactions

| Action | How to Do It |
|--------|--------------|
| Tap | Click |
| Scroll | Click and drag, or two-finger swipe |
| Swipe | Click and drag |
| Long press | Click and hold |
| Pinch/zoom | Option + drag |
| Rotate | Cmd+Left/Right Arrow |
| Shake | Device → Shake |

### Text Input

Click a text field and type with your keyboard. The Simulator uses your Mac's keyboard.

### Home Screen

- **Home button:** Cmd+Shift+H
- **Home (iPhone X+):** Drag up from bottom

---

## Changing Devices

You can test on different iPhone/iPad models:

### In Nativeline

Look for device selection in the toolbar or settings.

### In Simulator

1. File → Open Simulator
2. Choose a device type

### Why Different Devices?

| Device | Best For Testing |
|--------|------------------|
| iPhone SE | Small screens, compact layouts |
| iPhone 15 | Standard size, typical user |
| iPhone 15 Pro Max | Large screens, edge cases |
| iPad | Tablet layouts |

## Simulator Features

### Location Simulation

Test location features without moving:

1. Features → Location
2. Choose: City Bicycle Ride, Freeway Drive, Custom Location

Or set a specific location:
1. Features → Location → Custom Location
2. Enter latitude/longitude

### Screenshots

Save screenshots of your app:
- **Cmd+S** while Simulator is focused
- Saved to Desktop by default

### Screen Recording

Record your app in action:
1. File → Record Screen
2. Interact with your app
3. Stop recording
4. Video saved to Desktop

### Dark Mode Toggle

Quick appearance switch:
- Features → Toggle Appearance
- Or: Settings app → Display & Brightness

### Keyboard Toggle

Show/hide the software keyboard:
- Cmd+K
- Or: I/O → Keyboard → Toggle Software Keyboard

---

## First Launch

The first time the Simulator boots:

- Takes 30-60 seconds
- Downloads iOS components
- Creates virtual device

Subsequent launches are much faster (~5-10 seconds).

---

## What the Simulator Can't Do

Some features require a real device:

| Not Available | Alternative |
|---------------|-------------|
| Actual camera | Use photo library |
| Real GPS | Simulated locations |
| Face ID sensor | Simulated Face ID (Features menu) |
| Actual push notifications | Local notifications work |
| Apple Pay | Simulated in sandbox |
| Real performance | Test on device for speed |

For these features, deploy to TestFlight and test on a real iPhone.

## Performance Considerations

### Simulator vs Real Device

The Simulator is:
- **Faster** for some things (uses Mac's powerful CPU)
- **Slower** for others (graphics aren't optimized)
- **Not accurate** for performance testing

Always test on a real device before publishing.

### Improving Simulator Performance

If the Simulator is slow:
1. Use a simpler device (iPhone SE instead of Pro Max)
2. Close other Simulators
3. Close other heavy apps
4. Restart the Simulator
