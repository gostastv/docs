# Permissions

iOS apps must ask for permission to access certain device features. This protects user privacy and gives them control over their data.

## How Permissions Work

1. You enable a permission in Nativeline settings
2. You provide a **usage description** (why your app needs it)
3. When your app tries to use the feature, iOS shows a prompt
4. User grants or denies access
5. Your app respects their choice

## Available Permissions

### Camera

**Use for:** Taking photos, recording video, QR scanning

**Usage description example:**
> "This app needs camera access to take photos for your profile."

### Photo Library

**Use for:** Selecting existing photos, saving images

**Usage description example:**
> "This app needs access to your photos to let you choose images for posts."

### Location

**Two types:**
- **When In Use:** Only while app is open
- **Always:** Even in background (rare, requires justification)

**Usage description example:**
> "This app uses your location to show nearby restaurants."

### Microphone

**Use for:** Voice recording, audio messages, voice notes

**Usage description example:**
> "This app needs microphone access to record voice notes."

### Contacts

**Use for:** Importing contacts, finding friends

**Usage description example:**
> "This app accesses your contacts to help you find friends who also use the app."

### Calendar

**Use for:** Reading/writing calendar events

**Usage description example:**
> "This app needs calendar access to add events for your scheduled tasks."

### Reminders

**Use for:** Reading/writing reminders

**Usage description example:**
> "This app needs reminders access to sync your tasks with iOS Reminders."

### Motion & Fitness

**Use for:** Step counting, workout tracking

**Usage description example:**
> "This app tracks your steps to calculate your daily activity."

### Bluetooth

**Use for:** Connecting to Bluetooth devices

**Usage description example:**
> "This app uses Bluetooth to connect to your fitness tracker."

### Face ID / Touch ID

**Use for:** Biometric authentication

**Usage description example:**
> "This app uses Face ID to securely unlock your data."

### Tracking (App Tracking Transparency)

**Use for:** Tracking users across apps/websites

**Usage description example:**
> "This app uses tracking to show you relevant ads."

<Note>
  Most apps don't need tracking permission. Only enable if you're using advertising SDKs that require it.
</Note>

## Enabling Permissions

### In Nativeline

1. Open your project
2. Go to **Settings** → **Permissions**
3. Toggle on the permissions you need

### Via Chat

You can also ask the AI:

```
Add camera permission to the app with the description
"Take photos to share with friends"
```

## Writing Good Usage Descriptions

### Do

- ✅ Explain the specific feature that needs the permission
- ✅ Be clear and concise
- ✅ Describe the benefit to the user

### Don't

- ❌ Be vague: "This app needs access"
- ❌ Be technical: "Required for AVCaptureSession"
- ❌ Sound demanding: "You must allow access"

### Examples

| Permission | Bad | Good |
|------------|-----|------|
| Camera | "Camera access needed" | "Take photos to add to your recipes" |
| Location | "Location required" | "Find restaurants near you" |
| Photos | "Photo access" | "Select photos to share in your posts" |

---

## Permission States

Users can grant or deny permissions:

| State | Meaning | What to Do |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **Not Determined** | Haven't asked yet | First request will prompt |
| **Authorized** | User said yes | Feature works normally |
| **Denied** | User said no | Show explanation, guide to Settings |
| **Restricted** | Device-level restriction | Feature unavailable |

### Handling Denied Permissions

If a user denies permission:

1. Explain why the feature needs the permission
2. Provide a button to open Settings
3. Let them change their mind

Ask the AI:
```
When camera permission is denied, show a message explaining
why we need it and a button to open Settings.
```

## Testing Permissions

### In Simulator

Most permissions work in the Simulator:
- Photo Library (has sample photos)
- Location (can set custom location)
- Notifications

Some require a real device:
- Camera (Simulator has no camera)
- Face ID (use "Features → Face ID" menu to simulate)

### Resetting Permissions

To test the permission prompt again:

**Simulator:**
Device → Erase All Content and Settings

**Real device:**
Settings → General → Transfer or Reset → Reset → Reset Location & Privacy

## Common Permission Combinations

### Photo App

- Camera (take photos)
- Photo Library (select/save photos)

### Social App

- Camera (profile photos, posts)
- Photo Library (upload existing photos)
- Contacts (find friends)
- Notifications (alerts)

### Fitness App

- Location (track routes)
- Motion & Fitness (step counting)
- HealthKit (via Capabilities)

### Navigation App

- Notifications (arrival alerts)

## Permission Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Only request what you need" icon="shield">
    Don't enable permissions "just in case." Users are suspicious of apps requesting unnecessary access.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Request at the right time" icon="clock">
    Request permissions when the user tries to use the feature, not at app launch. Context helps users understand why.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Handle denial gracefully" icon="hand">
    Don't make the app unusable if a permission is denied. Provide alternatives or explain what's limited.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain before asking" icon="comment">
    For sensitive permissions, show your own explanation before triggering the system prompt. Users are more likely to accept when they understand.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## App Store Requirements

Apple reviews permission usage. They may reject apps that:

- Request unnecessary permissions
- Have vague usage descriptions
- Don't actually use the permissions they request
- Access data without clear user benefit

Make sure every permission has a legitimate, user-facing feature.
