# App Identity

App Identity settings control how your app identifies itself — the name users see, the icon on their home screen, and the unique identifiers that distinguish your app.

## Accessing App Identity

1. Open your project
2. Click **Settings** in the sidebar
3. Select **App Identity** (or look under General)

---

## Display Name

The name shown under your app icon and in iOS Settings.

### Requirements

- Maximum 30 characters (11 visible under icon)
- No special characters that could cause issues
- Should be unique and memorable

### Tips

- Keep it short — long names get truncated
- Make it recognizable
- Consider searchability in the App Store

### Changing the Name

1. Settings → App Identity → Display Name
2. Enter new name
3. Save

Changes appear immediately in the Simulator and when you rebuild.

---

## App Icon

The icon users see on their home screen, in Settings, and throughout iOS.

### Requirements

- **Size:** 1024×1024 pixels
- **Format:** PNG
- **No transparency** — use a solid background
- **No alpha channel** — Apple rejects icons with transparency

### Guidelines

- Simple, recognizable design
- Works at small sizes (the icon is shown at various sizes)
- Consistent with iOS design language
- No photos or screenshots of other apps

### Uploading an Icon

1. Settings → App Identity → App Icon
2. Click upload or drag image
3. Preview appears showing various sizes
4. Save

<Tip>
  Use tools like [App Icon Generator](https://appicon.co) to create properly sized assets from a single image.
</Tip>

## Version Number

The public version of your app (e.g., 1.0, 1.1, 2.0).

### Format

`major.minor.patch` — for example: `1.2.3`

- **Major:** Significant updates (2.0)
- **Minor:** New features (1.1)
- **Patch:** Bug fixes (1.0.1)

### When to Update

- Before each TestFlight upload
- Before App Store submission
- When releasing significant changes

### Changing Version

1. Settings → App Identity → Version
2. Enter new version (e.g., "1.1")
3. Save

---

## Build Number

Internal number for tracking builds. Must increase with each upload.

### Format

Any positive integer: 1, 2, 3, ... or 100, 101, 102...

### When to Update

- Every time you upload to TestFlight
- Every time you submit to App Store
- Apple requires each build number to be unique

### Strategy

Common approaches:
- Simple increment: 1, 2, 3, 4...
- Date-based: 20240115 (YYYYMMDD)
- Combined: Version + build (1001, 1002, 1003...)

---

## Bundle Identifier

A unique identifier for your app in Apple's ecosystem.

### Format

Reverse domain notation: `com.yourname.appname`

Examples:
- `com.johndoe.todolist`
- `com.mycompany.weatherapp`
- `io.startup.fitnesstrack`

### Requirements

- Must be unique worldwide
- Only letters, numbers, periods, and hyphens
- Usually matches your domain (if you have one)
- Cannot be changed after App Store submission

### Choosing a Bundle ID

If you don't have a domain, use a personal format:
- `com.yourname.appname`
- `io.yourname.appname`

<Warning>
  Choose carefully — Bundle IDs can't be changed once your app is on the App Store.
</Warning>

---

## Team ID

If you have an Apple Developer account, your Team ID links your app to your account.

### Where to Find It

1. [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com)
2. Account → Membership → Team ID

### When It's Needed

- TestFlight uploads
- App Store submission
- Capabilities requiring entitlements
