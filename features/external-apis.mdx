# External APIs

Want your app to use AI, accept payments, or connect to other services? You can integrate external APIs by simply telling the AI what you want.

## What Are External APIs?

External APIs let your app connect to services made by other companies:

    Maps, weather, social media, and thousands more

</CardGroup>

## How to Add an External API

Simply tell the AI what you want to do:

### Example: Adding OpenAI

> "I want to add a feature where users can ask a question and get an AI-generated response using the OpenAI API"

The AI will:
1. Add the necessary code to call OpenAI
2. Create a UI for the feature
3. Ask you for your API key
4. Help you store the key securely

### Example: Adding Payments

> "Add Stripe so users can purchase a premium upgrade for $9.99"

### Example: Adding Maps

> "Show the user's location on a map with nearby restaurants using Apple Maps"

## Getting API Keys

Most external services require an **API key** - a secret code that identifies your app.

### Where to Get Keys

| Service | Where to Get Key |
|---------|-----------------|
| OpenAI | [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) |
| Stripe | [dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys) |
| Google Maps | [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com) |
| Weather APIs | Varies by provider |

### Providing Your Key

When the AI asks for your API key, you can:
1. **Paste it in chat** - The AI will add it to your app securely
2. **Add it manually** - Follow the AI's instructions

<Warning>
  Never share your API keys publicly. They give access to your paid services and should be kept secret.
</Warning>

## How Keys Are Stored

Your API keys are stored securely in your generated app:

- **Stored in your Mac's Keychain** - encrypted and protected
- **Never uploaded** - stays on your computer
- **Not in code** - not visible in your Swift files
- **Accessed at runtime** - loaded when your app runs

This is the same secure storage that iOS uses for passwords.

## Common Integrations

### AI/Chat Features

> "Add a chat interface that sends messages to OpenAI and displays the response"

> "Create a feature that summarizes long text using Claude"

> "Add voice transcription using Whisper"

### Payments

> "Add a subscription with monthly and yearly options using RevenueCat"

> "Let users tip creators with Stripe"

### Location & Maps

> "Show a map with pins for saved locations"

> "Get the user's current address and display it"

### Social

> "Add sharing to Twitter and Instagram"

> "Let users log in with their Google account"

### Weather & Data

> "Show the current weather based on location"

> "Display stock prices that update in real-time"

## Best Practices

<Check>
  **Do:**
  - Use test/sandbox keys during development
  - Switch to production keys before publishing
  - Check API pricing before heavy usage
  - Handle errors gracefully (network issues, rate limits)
</Check>

<Warning>
  **Don't:**
  - Hardcode API keys in your code
  - Use production keys for testing
  - Ignore rate limits and quotas
  - Store sensitive user data from APIs
</Warning>

## API Costs

Many APIs have usage-based pricing. Before integrating:

1. **Check the pricing page** of the service
2. **Understand the free tier** limits
3. **Set up billing alerts** if available
4. **Start with small tests** before heavy usage

<Tip>
  Most services have generous free tiers. For testing and small apps, you often won't pay anything.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="'Invalid API key' error" icon="key">
    **Cause:** The API key is incorrect or expired.

    **Solution:**
    1. Double-check you copied the entire key
    2. Verify it's for the right environment (test vs production)
    3. Check if the key has expired
    4. Generate a new key if needed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="'Rate limit exceeded'" icon="gauge">
    **Cause:** You've made too many requests.

    **Solution:**
    1. Wait a few minutes and try again
    2. Implement caching to reduce calls
    3. Upgrade your API plan if needed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="'Network error'" icon="wifi-slash">
    **Cause:** Can't reach the API service.

    **Solution:**
    1. Check your internet connection
    2. Verify the service isn't down
    3. Try again in a few minutes
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="API response is unexpected" icon="circle-question">
    **Cause:** API format may have changed.

    **Solution:**
    1. Check the API documentation for updates
    2. Ask the AI to update the integration
    3. Look for version changes
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security Considerations

When using external APIs, remember:

- **Your API key = your account** - treat it like a password
- **User data** should be handled according to privacy laws
- **Some APIs** store data on their servers (check their privacy policy)
- **Test mode** data is usually deleted automatically

<Note>
  If you're building an app that handles sensitive data (health, financial), review the API provider's compliance certifications (HIPAA, SOC 2, etc.).
