# Capabilities

Capabilities are advanced iOS features that require special entitlements from Apple. They enable powerful functionality but require additional setup.

## What Are Capabilities?

Capabilities are different from permissions:

| Permissions | Capabilities |
|-------------|--------------|
| Runtime access (camera, location) | System-level features |
| User grants access | Requires Apple provisioning |
| Works immediately | Needs developer account setup |

## Capabilities and App Review

Apple reviews capability usage. They may reject apps that:

- Don't actually use enabled capabilities
- Use capabilities inappropriately
- Don't explain capability usage clearly
- Request sensitive data without justification

### HealthKit Specific

HealthKit apps face extra scrutiny:
- Must have clear health/fitness purpose
- Need detailed privacy policy
- May require additional review time

### Sign in with Apple

If your app offers third-party sign-in (Google, Facebook), you **must** also offer Sign in with Apple. This is an App Store requirement.
