# Code Editor

The Code Editor is a Pro plan feature that lets you see and edit the actual Swift code of your app. It's perfect for learning, making quick tweaks, and understanding what the AI creates.

<Note>
  The Code Editor is available on **Pro**, **Scale**, and **BYOK** plans. [Upgrade your plan](/getting-started/account-setup) to access this feature.
</Note>

## When to Use the Code Editor

### Learning Swift

Watch the AI generate code, then explore it in the editor. You'll learn:
- Swift syntax and patterns
- SwiftUI view structure
- How professional apps are organized
- iOS development best practices

### Quick Tweaks

Sometimes it's faster to edit code directly:
- Changing a color value
- Adjusting spacing
- Fixing a typo in text
- Modifying a simple condition

### Debugging

When something isn't working:
- Read the code to understand what's happening
- Check for obvious issues
- See exactly what the AI generated

### Customization

Make precise changes the AI might not understand:
- Complex animations
- Custom algorithms
- Fine-tuned performance optimizations

## The Code Editor Interface

### File Browser

On the left side, you'll see your project's file structure:

```
YourApp/
├── Views/
│   ├── ContentView.swift
│   ├── HomeView.swift
│   └── SettingsView.swift
├── Models/
│   ├── Task.swift
│   └── User.swift
├── Services/
│   └── DatabaseService.swift
└── App.swift
```

Click any file to open it in the editor.

### Code Editor Panel

The main area shows your code with:
- **Syntax highlighting** - Swift keywords, strings, and types are color-coded
- **Line numbers** - For easy navigation and reference
- **Search** - Find text in the current file
- **Auto-indentation** - Code stays properly formatted

### Console Panel

At the bottom, view:
- Build output and errors
- Print statements for debugging
- Compiler warnings

## File Organization

Nativeline organizes your code into standard Swift project structure:

| Folder | Contents |
|--------|----------|
| **Views/** | SwiftUI views (screens and components) |
| **Models/** | Data structures and types |
| **Services/** | API calls, database access, utilities |
| **Resources/** | Images, fonts, and other assets |

## Making Edits

### Simple Changes

1. Navigate to the file in the browser
2. Click to open it
3. Make your changes directly
4. Save (Cmd+S)
5. Nativeline automatically rebuilds

### Example: Changing a Color

```swift
// Before
Text("Hello")
    .foregroundColor(.blue)

// After
Text("Hello")
    .foregroundColor(.orange)
```

### Example: Adjusting Padding

```swift
// Before
VStack {
    // content
}
.padding(16)

// After
VStack {
    // content
}
.padding(24)
```

### Example: Fixing Text

```swift
// Before
Button("Sumbit")

// After
Button("Submit")
```

## Understanding Swift Code

### Views (SwiftUI)

Most of your app's UI is in SwiftUI views:

```swift
struct HomeView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Welcome!")
                .font(.title)

            Button("Get Started") {
                // action here
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Key concepts:**
- `struct HomeView: View` - Defines a view
- `var body: some View` - What the view displays
- `VStack`, `HStack`, `ZStack` - Layout containers
- Modifiers like `.font()`, `.padding()` - Styling

### Models (Data)

Data structures define your app's types:

```swift
struct Task: Identifiable {
    let id: UUID
    var title: String
    var isCompleted: Bool
    var dueDate: Date?
}
```

### Observable State

State management using `@Observable`:

```swift
@Observable
class TaskManager {
    var tasks: [Task] = []

    func addTask(_ title: String) {
        tasks.append(Task(title: title))
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Do

<Check>
  - Save frequently (Cmd+S)
  - Make small, incremental changes
  - Test after each change
  - Use the AI for complex changes
  - Keep backups of working code
</Check>

### Don't

<Warning>
  - Make massive changes without testing
  - Delete code you don't understand
  - Ignore compiler errors
  - Forget to save before rebuilding
</Warning>

## When Code Changes Don't Work

If your edits cause build errors:

1. **Check the error message** in the console
2. **Undo your change** (Cmd+Z) if you can't fix it
3. **Ask the AI** - "Fix this error: [paste error message]"
4. **Rebuild** after fixing

### Common Swift Errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Missing `}` | Unbalanced braces | Add the missing brace |
| Type mismatch | Wrong data type | Check variable types |
| Unknown identifier | Typo or missing import | Check spelling, add import |
| Missing `return` | Function needs return value | Add return statement |

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Cmd+S | Save file |
| Cmd+Z | Undo |
| Cmd+Shift+Z | Redo |
| Cmd+F | Find in file |
| Cmd+G | Find next |
| Cmd+/ | Toggle comment |

## Combining AI and Manual Edits

The best workflow combines both:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ask the AI for the big picture">
    "Create a settings screen with toggle options"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the generated code">
    Open the file in the editor to see what was created
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make small tweaks yourself">
    Adjust colors, padding, or text directly
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use AI for complex changes">
    "Add an animation when toggles change"
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Code Editor vs AI Chat

| Use Code Editor | Use AI Chat |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Fixing typos | Creating new features |
| Changing colors/values | Adding screens |
| Adjusting spacing | Complex logic |
| Learning the code | Major refactoring |
| Quick tweaks | Design changes |
