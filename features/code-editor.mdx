# Code Editor

The Code Editor lets you see and edit the actual Swift code of your app. It's perfect for learning, making quick tweaks, and understanding what the AI creates.

<Note>
  The Code Editor is available on **Pro** and **Scale** plans. [Upgrade your plan](/introduction/plans-and-pricing) to access this feature.
</Note>

## When to Use the Code Editor

### Learning Swift

Watch the AI generate code, then explore it in the editor. You'll learn:
- Swift syntax and patterns
- SwiftUI view structure
- How professional apps are organized
- iOS development best practices

### Quick Tweaks

Sometimes it's faster to edit directly:
- Changing a color value
- Adjusting spacing
- Fixing a typo in text
- Modifying a simple condition

### Debugging

When something isn't working:
- Read the code to understand what's happening
- Add print statements
- Check for obvious issues
- See exactly what the AI generated

### Reading Logs

View runtime output:
- Print statements
- Error messages
- App behavior traces

## The Code Editor Interface

### File Browser

On the left, your project's file structure:

```
YourApp/
├── Views/
│   ├── ContentView.swift
│   ├── HomeView.swift
│   └── SettingsView.swift
├── Models/
│   ├── Task.swift
│   └── User.swift
├── Services/
│   └── DatabaseService.swift
└── App.swift
```

Click any file to open it.

### Editor Panel

The main area shows code with:
- **Syntax highlighting** — Colors for keywords, strings, types
- **Line numbers** — For navigation and reference
- **Search** — Find text (Cmd+F)
- **Auto-indentation** — Code stays formatted

### Logs Panel

At the bottom (toggle to show):
- Build output and errors
- Print statements from your code
- Runtime logs

---

## File Organization

Nativeline organizes code into standard Swift structure:

| Folder | Contents |
|--------|----------|
| **Views/** | SwiftUI views (screens and components) |
| **Models/** | Data structures and types |
| **Services/** | API calls, database access, utilities |
| **Resources/** | Images, fonts, assets |

---

## Making Edits

### Editing Workflow

1. Navigate to the file
2. Click to open
3. Make changes
4. Save (Cmd+S)
5. App rebuilds automatically

### Example: Changing a Color

```swift
// Before
Text("Hello")
    .foregroundColor(.blue)

// After
Text("Hello")
    .foregroundColor(.orange)
```

### Example: Adjusting Padding

```swift
// Before
VStack {
    // content
}
.padding(16)

// After
VStack {
    // content
}
.padding(24)
```

### Example: Fixing Text

```swift
// Before
Button("Sumbit")

// After
Button("Submit")
```

## Understanding Swift Code

### Views (SwiftUI)

Most UI is in SwiftUI views:

```swift
struct HomeView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Welcome!")
                .font(.title)

            Button("Get Started") {
                // action here
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Key concepts:**
- `struct HomeView: View` — Defines a view
- `var body: some View` — What it displays
- `VStack`, `HStack`, `ZStack` — Layout containers
- Modifiers like `.font()`, `.padding()` — Styling

### Models (Data)

Data structures:

```swift
struct Task: Identifiable {
    let id: UUID
    var title: String
    var isCompleted: Bool
    var dueDate: Date?
}
```

### State Management

Using `@Observable`:

```swift
@Observable
class TaskManager {
    var tasks: [Task] = []

    func addTask(_ title: String) {
        tasks.append(Task(title: title))
    }
}
```

## Reading Logs

### Accessing Logs

1. Open Code Editor
2. Find the Logs panel/tab
3. Run your app
4. Watch output appear

### Adding Log Statements

Ask the AI:
```
Add print statements to the save function to trace what's happening
```

Or add manually:
```swift
print("Save button tapped")
print("Saving data: \(userData)")
```

### Log Types

| Log | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| Build output | Compilation status |
| Errors | What went wrong |
| Print statements | Your debug output |
| Runtime warnings | iOS system messages |

See [Reading App Logs](/guides/app-logs) for more details.

## Best Practices

### Do

- ✅ Save frequently (Cmd+S)
- ✅ Make small, incremental changes
- ✅ Test after each change
- ✅ Use AI for complex changes
- ✅ Learn from the generated code

### Don't

- ❌ Make massive changes without testing
- ❌ Delete code you don't understand
- ❌ Ignore compiler errors
- ❌ Forget to save before rebuilding

---

## When Code Changes Don't Work

If your edits cause build errors:

1. **Check the error** in the Logs or chat
2. **Undo** (Cmd+Z) if you can't fix it
3. **Ask the AI:** "Fix this error: [paste error]"
4. **Rebuild** after fixing

### Common Swift Errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Missing `}` | Unbalanced braces | Add missing brace |
| Type mismatch | Wrong data type | Check types |
| Unknown identifier | Typo or missing import | Check spelling |
| Missing `return` | Function needs return | Add return statement |

---

## Code Editor vs AI Chat

| Use Code Editor | Use AI Chat |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Fixing typos | Creating new features |
| Changing values | Adding screens |
| Adjusting colors | Complex logic |
| Learning the code | Major refactoring |
| Quick tweaks | Design changes |

### Combining Both

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use AI for the big picture">
    "Create a settings screen with toggle options"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the generated code">
    Open in Code Editor to understand what was created
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make small tweaks yourself">
    Adjust colors, padding, or text directly
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use AI for complex changes">
    "Add an animation when toggles change"
  </Step>
</Steps>
