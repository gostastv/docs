# Simulator Issues

The iOS Simulator is a virtual iPhone on your Mac. It's where you test your apps before deploying to real devices. Here's how to fix common Simulator problems.

## Simulator Won't Appear

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Simulator window is hidden" icon="eye-slash">
    **The Simulator is running but not visible.**

    **Solutions:**
    1. Check behind other windows
    2. Check other Spaces (swipe with 3 fingers on trackpad)
    3. Click **Simulator** in the Dock, then **Window → Bring All to Front**
    4. Look for the Simulator icon in the menu bar
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Simulator not installed" icon="download">
    **The iOS Simulator component isn't on your Mac.**

    **Solution:**
    1. Open Xcode
    2. Go to **Xcode → Settings → Platforms**
    3. Click **+** and select **iOS**
    4. Wait for download (2-4 GB)
    5. Restart Nativeline
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="First boot is slow" icon="clock">
    **The Simulator takes forever on first launch.**

    **This is normal!** First boot can take 30-60 seconds.

    **Tips:**
    - Be patient on first launch
    - Don't interrupt the boot process
    - Subsequent launches are much faster
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Simulator crashed" icon="bomb">
    **The Simulator crashed and won't restart.**

    **Solutions:**
    1. Force quit Simulator: **Cmd+Option+Esc** → Select Simulator → Force Quit
    2. In Terminal, run: `killall Simulator`
    3. Restart Nativeline
    4. If it keeps crashing, reset the Simulator (see below)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Wrong Device Showing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Wrong iPhone model" icon="mobile-alt">
    **You want a different iPhone model.**

    **Solution:**
    1. In Simulator, go to **File → Open Simulator**
    2. Choose the device you want (iPhone 16, SE, etc.)
    3. Nativeline will use whichever Simulator is active
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Want iPad instead of iPhone" icon="tablet">
    **You need to test on iPad.**

    **Solution:**
    1. In Simulator, go to **File → Open Simulator → iPad**
    2. Choose an iPad model
    3. Rebuild your app from Nativeline
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="No devices available" icon="mobile">
    **The device list is empty.**

    **Solution:**
    1. Open Xcode → **Window → Devices and Simulators**
    2. Click **Simulators** tab
    3. Click **+** at bottom left
    4. Create the device you need
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Performance Problems

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Simulator is very slow" icon="gauge-simple">
    **Everything in the Simulator is sluggish.**

    **Causes & Solutions:**

    **1. First boot is always slow** - Wait a minute

    **2. Mac is under heavy load**
    - Close other applications
    - Check Activity Monitor for CPU hogs
    - Restart your Mac

    **3. Low memory**
    - Close Chrome tabs (notorious memory user)
    - Close other apps
    - Check available RAM in Activity Monitor

    **4. Using a large device**
    - Switch to iPhone SE (uses less resources)
    - Pro Max models are more demanding

    **5. Simulator needs reset**
    - Device → Erase All Content and Settings
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Animations are choppy" icon="film">
    **Animations stutter in the Simulator.**

    **This is often normal.** The Simulator isn't as fast as a real device for rendering.

    **Tips:**
    - Simplify animations during development
    - Test on a real device via TestFlight for true performance
    - Reduce animation complexity if needed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="App is slow but Mac is fine" icon="mobile-signal">
    **The Simulator runs fine, but your app is slow.**

    **Possible causes:**
    - Inefficient code in your app
    - Large data sets
    - Memory leaks

    **Solutions:**
    - Ask the AI to optimize slow areas
    - Profile in Xcode (Product → Profile)
    - Test on a real device to confirm
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## App Not Updating

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Seeing old version of app" icon="rotate">
    **Changes aren't reflected in the Simulator.**

    **Solutions:**
    1. Make sure the build succeeded (check for "Success" status)
    2. Wait for the app to fully relaunch
    3. In Simulator, stop the app (Cmd+Q) and wait for it to relaunch
    4. Device → Restart (soft restart)
    5. Device → Erase All Content and Settings (nuclear option)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="App won't install" icon="download">
    **The app fails to install on the Simulator.**

    **Solutions:**
    1. Erase and reinstall: Device → Erase All Content and Settings
    2. Delete the app from Simulator home screen, then rebuild
    3. Restart the Simulator
    4. Check for disk space on your Mac
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Old data persists" icon="database">
    **The app shows old data even after code changes.**

    **This is often expected.** The Simulator maintains a sandboxed filesystem.

    **To clear data:**
    1. Delete the app from Simulator (long press → Remove App)
    2. Or: Device → Erase All Content and Settings
    3. Rebuild from Nativeline
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Input Problems

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keyboard not appearing" icon="keyboard">
    **The on-screen keyboard doesn't show when tapping text fields.**

    **This is normal!** By default, the Simulator uses your Mac's keyboard.

    **To show the software keyboard:**
    1. Press **Cmd+K** to toggle the keyboard
    2. Or: I/O → Keyboard → Toggle Software Keyboard
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't type in text fields" icon="i-cursor">
    **Typing on Mac keyboard doesn't work in Simulator.**

    **Solutions:**
    1. Click inside the text field in the Simulator first
    2. Make sure the Simulator window is focused (click on it)
    3. Check I/O → Keyboard → Use Hardware Keyboard is enabled
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Touch not registering" icon="hand-pointer">
    **Clicks/taps aren't being recognized.**

    **Solutions:**
    1. Make sure you're clicking inside the app, not the device bezel
    2. Wait for animations to complete before tapping
    3. Restart the Simulator
    4. Check if UI elements are actually tappable (might be disabled)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Resetting the Simulator

When all else fails, reset to a clean state:

### Soft Reset (Restart)

1. In Simulator: **Device → Restart**
2. Waits for the device to reboot
3. Rebuild your app

### Hard Reset (Erase Everything)

1. In Simulator: **Device → Erase All Content and Settings**
2. Confirm the reset
3. Wait for the fresh boot
4. Rebuild your app

This removes:
- All installed apps
- All saved data
- All settings
- Returns to factory state

### Delete and Recreate Simulator

For stubborn issues:

1. Open Xcode → **Window → Devices and Simulators**
2. Select the problematic simulator
3. Right-click → **Delete**
4. Click **+** to create a new one
5. Choose your desired device type

## Useful Simulator Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|

## Simulator vs Real Device

| Simulator | Real Device |
|-----------|-------------|
| Uses Mac CPU | Uses iPhone CPU |
| Mouse clicks | Finger touches |
| No camera | Full camera |
| No GPS (simulated) | Real GPS |
| Unlimited battery | Real battery |
| Mac network | Cellular + WiFi |

For final testing, always test on a real device via TestFlight!
