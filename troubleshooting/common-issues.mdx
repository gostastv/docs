## Building Your App

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="'Build failed' error" icon="circle-xmark">
    **Your app couldn't compile successfully.**

    **This is normal!** Nativeline automatically:
    1. Detects the error
    2. Proposes a fix
    3. Applies the fix if you approve
    4. Rebuilds

    **If it keeps failing:**
    - Describe the issue in your own words
    - Provide more context about what you wanted
    - Try a simpler request first
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Simulator won't launch" icon="mobile-screen">
    **The iOS Simulator isn't appearing after a build.**

    **Solutions:**
    1. Check if the Simulator window is behind other windows
    2. Check other Spaces/Desktops (swipe left/right on trackpad)
    3. Open Xcode → Window → Devices and Simulators → check simulator health
    4. Go to Xcode → Settings → Platforms → ensure iOS is installed
    5. Restart Nativeline

    **First launch?** The Simulator takes 30-60 seconds to boot the first time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="App doesn't update after changes" icon="rotate">
    **You're seeing the old version in the Simulator.**

    **Solutions:**
    1. Check for build errors in the chat
    2. Wait for "Success" status before testing
    3. Stop the app in Simulator (Cmd+Q) and let it relaunch
    4. Simulator → Device → Erase All Content and Settings
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Build is taking forever" icon="clock">
    **Builds are unusually slow.**

    **Normal durations:**
    - First build: 30-60 seconds
    - Subsequent builds: 5-15 seconds

    **If slower:**
    1. Check Activity Monitor for CPU usage
    2. Close other heavy applications
    3. Restart your Mac
    4. Make sure you have at least 10GB free disk space
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## AI & Chat

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="AI doesn't understand my request" icon="circle-question">
    **The AI built something different than what you wanted.**

    **Solutions:**
    1. Be more specific: "Add a blue button" → "Add a 50pt tall button with blue (#007AFF) background and white text"
    2. Use reference images: Attach a screenshot of what you want
    3. Break it down: Instead of one complex request, make several simpler ones
    4. Describe the user experience: What should users see and do?
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="'Out of bits' message" icon="empty-set">
    **You've used your monthly AI usage allowance.**

    **Options:**
    1. Wait for your monthly reset (check Settings for your billing date)

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="AI keeps making the same mistake" icon="repeat">
    **The AI is stuck in a loop.**

    **Solutions:**
    1. Describe the issue differently
    2. Provide more specific requirements
    3. Clear the conversation (your code is preserved)
    4. Try a completely different approach
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Conversation disappeared" icon="comments">
    **Your chat history is gone.**

    **Possible causes:**
    - Conversation was cleared manually
    - Project was opened in a different location
    - `.nativeline` folder was deleted

    **Your code is safe!** Only the conversation history is affected. The AI can learn about your app again from the code.
  </Accordion>

## Performance
