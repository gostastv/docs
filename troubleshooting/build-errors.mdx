# Build Errors

Build errors happen when your app can't be compiled. They're a normal part of development, and Nativeline has smart tools to help fix them automatically.

## How Build Errors Work

When you build your app, Xcode compiles the Swift code into an executable. If something's wrong with the code, the build fails with an error.

### The Automatic Fix Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Build fails">
    Xcode reports an error
  </Step>
  <Step title="AI detects error">
    Nativeline captures the error message
  </Step>
  <Step title="AI analyzes">
    The Debugger agent identifies the root cause
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fix is proposed">
    You see the proposed fix in chat
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fix is applied">
    The code is corrected
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rebuild">
    The app is built again (up to 3 attempts)
  </Step>
</Steps>

Most errors are fixed automatically within 1-3 attempts.

## Types of Build Errors

### Code Errors (AI Can Fix)

These are errors in the Swift code itself. The AI handles these well:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Syntax Errors" icon="code">
    **Example:** Missing semicolon, unbalanced braces, typos

    ```swift
    // Error: Expected '}' at end of closure
    Button("Tap") {
        print("tapped")
    // Missing closing brace
    ```

    **The AI will:** Add the missing brace
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Type Mismatches" icon="not-equal">
    **Example:** Passing a String where an Int is expected

    ```swift
    // Error: Cannot convert value of type 'String' to expected type 'Int'
    let count: Int = "five"
    ```

    **The AI will:** Fix the type or convert the value
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Missing Imports" icon="file-import">
    **Example:** Using SwiftUI without importing it

    ```swift
    // Error: Cannot find type 'View' in scope
    struct ContentView: View {
    ```

    **The AI will:** Add `import SwiftUI` at the top
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Undefined Variables" icon="question">
    **Example:** Using a variable that doesn't exist

    ```swift
    // Error: Cannot find 'userName' in scope
    Text(userName)
    ```

    **The AI will:** Define the variable or fix the typo
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Missing Return Statements" icon="arrow-right-from-bracket">
    **Example:** Function needs to return a value

    ```swift
    // Error: Missing return in function expected to return 'String'
    func greeting() -> String {
        let text = "Hello"
        // Missing: return text
    }
    ```

    **The AI will:** Add the return statement
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Protocol Conformance" icon="list-check">
    **Example:** Missing required protocol methods

    ```swift
    // Error: Type 'MyView' does not conform to protocol 'View'
    struct MyView: View {
        // Missing: var body: some View
    }
    ```

    **The AI will:** Implement the required properties/methods
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Configuration Errors (May Need Your Help)

These are project-level issues. The AI provides guidance, but you may need to act:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Signing Errors" icon="signature">
    **Example:** "Signing requires a development team"

    **What's happening:** Xcode doesn't know which Apple Developer account to use.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Open the project in Xcode
    2. Select your target → Signing & Capabilities
    3. Choose your team from the dropdown
    4. Let Xcode resolve signing issues
    5. Return to Nativeline and rebuild
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Provisioning Profile Errors" icon="id-card">
    **Example:** "No provisioning profile found"

    **What's happening:** Apple certificates aren't set up for this app.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Open Xcode → Settings → Accounts
    2. Make sure you're signed in with your Apple ID
    3. Click your team → Download Manual Profiles
    4. In your project, ensure "Automatically manage signing" is checked
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Bundle Identifier Conflicts" icon="copy">
    **Example:** "Bundle identifier already in use"

    **What's happening:** Another app uses this same identifier.

    **Solution:** Change the bundle identifier in Settings → App Identity to something unique (e.g., `com.yourname.uniqueappname`)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Minimum Deployment Target" icon="calendar">
    **Example:** "API not available before iOS 17"

    **What's happening:** You're using features that require a newer iOS version.

    **Solution:** The AI typically handles this by updating the deployment target, but if it persists, ask the AI to check the iOS version requirements.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### System Errors (External Issues)

These are problems outside the code. The AI provides guidance:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Xcode Not Found" icon="circle-exclamation">
    **Solution:** Install Xcode from the Mac App Store
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="SDK Not Installed" icon="download">
    **Solution:**
    1. Open Xcode → Settings → Platforms
    2. Download the iOS SDK
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Simulator Not Available" icon="mobile-screen-button">
    **Solution:**
    1. Open Xcode → Window → Devices and Simulators
    2. Add a simulator if none exist
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Disk Full" icon="hard-drive">
    **Solution:** Free up disk space (builds need ~5GB working space)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Reading Error Messages

Error messages have a specific format:

```
/path/to/File.swift:42:15: error: Cannot find 'userName' in scope
```

| Part | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `/path/to/File.swift` | The file with the error |
| `42` | Line number |
| `15` | Column number |
| `error:` | Severity (error vs warning) |
| `Cannot find 'userName' in scope` | The actual problem |

## When Automatic Fixes Fail

If the AI can't fix an error after 3 attempts:

### 1. Describe the Error Differently

Instead of waiting for auto-fix:

> "I'm getting an error that says 'userName' isn't found. I want to display the logged-in user's name in this text field."

### 2. Provide More Context

> "The error is in the ProfileView. The userName should come from the UserManager that we created earlier."

### 3. Ask for a Different Approach

> "Let's try a different approach. Instead of passing the userName, can we store it in UserDefaults and read it from there?"

### 4. Simplify the Request

If a complex feature keeps failing, break it down:

> "Let's start simpler. First, just add a text field that shows 'Hello'. We'll add the actual user name later."

## Common Cascading Errors

Sometimes one error causes many others. For example:

```
error: Cannot find type 'User' in scope
error: Cannot find 'user' in scope
error: Cannot find 'user.name' in scope
error: Cannot find 'user.email' in scope
error: Cannot find 'user.avatar' in scope
```

**These 5 errors have ONE root cause:** The `User` type is missing.

The AI is trained to find the root cause, not just fix each error individually.

## Preventing Build Errors

<Check>
  **Best practices:**
  - Test after each change (catch errors early)
  - Be specific in your prompts (reduces misunderstandings)
  - Build incrementally (smaller changes = fewer errors)
  - Let the AI finish before making new requests
</Check>

## When to Worry (And When Not To)

### Don't Worry

- Single build error → Normal, will be fixed
- 2-3 retry attempts → The AI is working on it
- "Fixing..." message → Solution in progress

### Maybe Worry

- 5+ retry attempts on same error → Describe differently
- Errors returning after fix → May need different approach
- Configuration errors → May need your intervention

### Definitely Check

- Errors mentioning certificates/signing → Open in Xcode to configure
- "No team selected" → Need Apple Developer account setup
- Disk space errors → Free up storage
